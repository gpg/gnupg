The list of authors who signed the Developer's Certificate of Origin
is kept in the GIT master branch's copy of this file.


Other authors
=============

The need for copyright assignments to the FSF has been waived on
2013-03-29; the need for copyright disclaimers for translations
already in December 2012.

The files common/libestream.[ch] are maintained as a separate project
by g10 Code GmbH.  These files, as used here, are considered part of
GnuPG.

The RPM specs file scripts/gnupg.spec has been contributed by
several people.

The function build_argv in agent/w32main.c is based on code from
Alexandre Julliard.

The gpg-zip documentation is based on the manpage for gpg-zip, written
by Colin Tuckley and Daniel Leidert for the GNU/Debian distribution.

GnuPG is distributed under the GNU General Public License, version 2
or later.  A few files are under the Lesser General Public License, a
few other files carry the all permissive license note as found at the
bottom of this file.  Certain files in keyserver/ allow one specific
exception:

  In addition, as a special exception, the Free Software Foundation
  gives permission to link the code of the keyserver helper tools:
  gpgkeys_ldap, gpgkeys_curl and gpgkeys_hkp with the OpenSSL
  project's "OpenSSL" library (or with modified versions of it that
  use the same license as the "OpenSSL" library), and distribute the
  linked executables.  You must obey the GNU General Public License
  in all respects for all of the code used other than "OpenSSL".  If
  you modify this file, you may extend this exception to your version
  of the file, but you are not obligated to do so.  If you do not
  wish to do so, delete this exception statement from your version.

Note that the gpgkeys_* binaries are currently installed under the
name gpg2keys_*.
