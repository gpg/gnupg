-------------------------------------------------

 * If the agent's --use-standard-socket option is active, all tools
   try to start and daemonize the agent on the fly.  In the past this
   was only supported on W32; on non-W32 systems the new configure
   option --enable-standard-socket may now be used to use this feature
   by default.

   all features of gpgsm-gencert.sh in standard mode.

 * New option --re-import for GPGSM's IMPORT server command.

 * Enhanced writing of existing keys to OpenPGP v2 cards.

 * Add hack to the internal CCID driver to allow the use of some

 * SCDAEMON is now aware of the Geldkarte.

 * The SCDAEMON option --allow-admin is now used by default.

 * GPGCONF now restarts SCdaemon if necessary.

-------------------------------------------------

 * [gpg] New keyserver helper gpg2keys_kdns as generic DNS CERT

 * Allow encryption with legacy Elgamal sign+encrypt keys with option
   --rfc2440.

 * Windows is now a supported platform.

 * Made sure that under Windows the file permissions of the socket are
   taken into account.  This required a change of our socket emulation
   code and changed the IPC protocol under Windows.


Noteworthy changes in version 2.0.7 (2007-09-10)
------------------------------------------------

 * Fixed encryption problem if duplicate certificates are in the
   keybox.

 * Made it work on Windows Vista.  Note that the entire Windows port

------------------------------------------------

 * GPGSM does now grok --default-key.

 * GPGCONF is now aware of --default-key and --encrypt-to.

   systems without the funopen/fopencookie API.

 * PKCS#12 import now tries several encodings in case the passphrase
   was not utf-8 encoded.  New option --p12-charset for gpgsm.

 * Improved the libgcrypt logging support in all modules.


Noteworthy changes in version 2.0.3 (2007-03-08)
------------------------------------------------

 * By default, do not allow processing multiple plaintexts in a single
   stream.  Many programs that called GnuPG were assuming that GnuPG
   did not permit this, and were thus not using the plaintext boundary
   status tags that GnuPG provides.  This change makes GnuPG reject
   such messages by default which makes those programs safe again.
   --allow-multiple-messages returns to the old behavior. [CVE-2007-1263].

 * New --verify-option show-primary-uid-only.

 * gpgconf may now reads a global configuration file to select which
   options are changeable by a frontend.  The new applygnupgdefaults
   tool may be used by an admin to set default options for all users.

   DINSIG and the NKS applications are now also aware of PIN pads.

------------------------------------------------

 * Fixed a serious and exploitable bug in processing encrypted
   packages. [CVE-2006-6235].

 * Added --passphrase-repeat to set the number of times GPG will
   prompt for a new passphrase to be repeated.  This is useful to help
   memorize a new passphrase.  The default is 1 repetition.

 * Using a PIN pad does now also work for the signing key.

 * A warning is displayed by gpg-agent if a new passphrase is too
   short.  New option --min-passphrase-len defaults to 8.

 * The status code BEGIN_SIGNING now shows the used hash algorithms.


Noteworthy changes in version 2.0.1 (2006-11-28)
------------------------------------------------

 * Experimental support for the PIN pads of the SPR 532 and the Kaan
   Advanced card readers.  Add "disable-keypad" scdaemon.conf if you
   don't want it.  Does currently only work for the OpenPGP card and
   its authentication and decrypt keys.

 * Fixed build problems on some some platforms and crashes on amd64.

 * Fixed a buffer overflow in gpg2. [bug#728,CVE-2006-6169]

   signatures or keys with insane lengths.

 * Fixed v3 keyID calculation bug in gpg2.

 * More tweaks for certificates without extensions.

 * The gpg code from 1.4.5 has been fully merged into this release.
   The configure option --enable-gpg is still required to build this
   gpg part.  For production use of OpenPGP the gpg version 1.4.5 is
   still recommended.  Note, that gpg will be installed under the name
   gpg2 to allow coexisting with an 1.4.x gpg.

 * API change in gpg-agent's pkdecrypt command.  Thus an older gpgsm
   may not be used with the current gpg-agent.

 * The scdaemon will now call a script on reader status changes.

 * gpgsm now allows file descriptor passing for "INPUT", "OUTPUT" and
   "MESSAGE".

   commands.

 * Internal changes for OpenPGP cards. New Assuan command WRITEKEY.

 * GNU Pth is now a hard requirement.

 * [scdaemon] Support for OpenSC has been removed.  Instead a new and
   straightforward pkcs#15 modules has been written.  As of now it
   does allows only signing using TCOS cards but we are going to
   enhance it to match all the old capabilities.

 * [gpg-agent] New option --write-env-file and Assuan command
   UPDATESTARTUPTTY.

 * [gpg-agent] New option --default-cache-ttl-ssh to set the TTL for
   SSH passphrase caching independent from the other passphrases.

   /etc/skel/.gnupg.

 * Various minor bug fixes and cleanups; mainly gpgsm and gpg-agent
   related.


Noteworthy changes in version 1.9.3 (2003-12-23)
------------------------------------------------

 * New gpgsm options --{enable,disable}-ocsp to validate keys using
   OCSP. This option requires a not yet released DirMngr version.
   Default is disabled.

 * The --log-file option may now be used to print logs to a socket.

   not work on all systems and falls back to stderr if there is a
   problem with the socket.

   disable OpenSC use at runtime, so that PC/SC or ct-API can still be
   used directly.

 * Rudimentary support for the SCR335 smartcard reader using an
   internal driver.  Requires current libusb from CVS.

 * Bug fixes.


Noteworthy changes in version 1.9.0 (2003-08-05)
------------------------------------------------

      ====== PLEASE SEE README-alpha =======

 * ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf-1.9.0 is fist tried as config file before the
   usual gpg.conf.

 * Removed the -k, -kv and -kvv commands.  -k is now an alias to
   --list-keys.  New command -K as alias for --list-secret-keys.

 * Removed --run-as-shm-coprocess feature.

 * gpg does now also use libgcrypt, libgpg-error is required.

 * New gpgsm commands --call-dirmngr and --call-protect-tool.

 * The content-type attribute is now recognized and created.

 * The agent does now reread certain options on receiving a HUP.

 * The pinentry is now forked for each request so that clients with
   different environments are supported.  When running in daemon mode
   and --keep-display is not used the DISPLAY variable is ignored.

 * Merged stuff from the newpg branch and started this new
   development branch.
