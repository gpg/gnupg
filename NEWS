Noteworthy changes in version 1.4.9 (2008-03-26)
------------------------------------------------

    * Improved AES encryption performance by more than 20% (on ia32).
      Decryption is also a bit faster.

    * Fixed possible memory corruption bug in 1.4.8 while importing
      OpenPGP keys.


Noteworthy changes in version 1.4.8 (2007-12-20)
------------------------------------------------
        
             *******************************************
             * A decade of GnuPG: g10-0.0.0.tar.gz was *
             *      released exactly 10 years ago.     *
             *******************************************

    * Changed the license to GPLv3.

    * Improved detection of keyrings specified multiple times.

    * Changes to better cope with broken keyservers.

    * Minor bug fixes.

    * The new OpenPGP standard is now complete, and has been published
      as RFC-4880.  The GnuPG --openpgp mode (note this is not the
      default) has been updated to match the new standard.  The
      --rfc2440 option can be used to return to the older RFC-2440
      behavior.  The main differences between the two are
      "--enable-dsa2 --no-rfc2440-text --escape-from-lines
      --require-cross-certification".

    * By default (i.e. --gnupg mode), --require-cross-certification is
      now on.  --rfc2440-text and --force-v3-sigs are now off.

    * Allow encryption using legacy Elgamal sign+encrypt keys if
      option --rfc2440 is used.

    * Fixed the auto creation of the key stub for smartcards.  

    * Fixed a rare bug in decryption using the OpenPGP card.

    * Fix RFC-4880 typo in the SHA-224 hash prefix.  Old SHA-224
      signatures will continue to work.


Noteworthy changes in version 1.4.7 (2007-03-05)
------------------------------------------------

    * By default, do not allow processing multiple plaintexts in a
      single stream.  Many programs that called GnuPG were assuming
      that GnuPG did not permit this, and were thus not using the
      plaintext boundary status tags that GnuPG provides.  This change
      makes GnuPG reject such messages by default which makes those
      programs safe again.  --allow-multiple-messages returns to the
      old behavior. [CVE-2007-1263].

    * [W32] The environment variable LANGUAGE may be used to override
      the language given by HKCU\Software\GNU\GnuPG:Lang.  The
      language files "*.mo" are expected in a directory named
      "gnupg.nls" below the directory with the gpg.exe binary.

    * New --verify-option show-primary-uid-only. 


Noteworthy changes in version 1.4.6 (2006-12-06)
------------------------------------------------

    * Fixed a serious and exploitable bug in processing encrypted
      packages. [CVE-2006-6235].

    * Fixed a buffer overflow in gpg. [bug#728, CVE-2006-6169]

    * Fixed a bug while decrypting certain compressed and encrypted
      messages. [bug#537]
 
    * Added --s2k-count to set the number of times passphrase mangling
      is repeated.  The default is 65536 times.

    * Added --passphrase-repeat to set the number of times GPG will
      prompt for a new passphrase to be repeated.  This is useful to
      help memorize a new passphrase.  The default is 1 repetition.

    * Added a GPL license exception to the keyserver helper programs
      gpgkeys_ldap, gpgkeys_curl, and gpgkeys_hkp, to clarify any
      potential questions about the ability to distribute binaries
      that link to the OpenSSL library.  GnuPG does not link directly
      to OpenSSL, but libcurl (used for HKP, HTTP, and FTP) and
      OpenLDAP (used for LDAP) may.  Note that this license exception
      is considered a bug fix and is intended to forgive any
      violations pertaining to this issue, including those that may
      have occurred in the past.

    * Man pages are now built from the same source as those of GnuPG-2.


Noteworthy changes in version 1.4.5 (2006-08-01)
------------------------------------------------

    * Reverted check for valid standard handles under Windows.

    * More DSA2 tweaks.

    * Fixed a problem uploading certain keys to the smart card.

    * Fixed 2 more possible memory allocation attacks.

    * Added Norwegian translation.


Noteworthy changes in version 1.4.4 (2006-06-25)
------------------------------------------------

    * User IDs are now capped at 2048 bytes.  This avoids a memory
      allocation attack (see CVE-2006-3082).

    * Added support for the SHA-224 hash.  Like the SHA-384 hash, it
      is mainly useful when DSS (the US Digital Signature Standard)
      compatibility is desired.

    * Added support for the latest update to DSA keys and signatures.
      This allows for larger keys than 1024 bits and hashes other than
      SHA-1 and RIPEMD/160.  Note that not all OpenPGP implementations
      can handle these new keys and signatures yet.  See
      "--enable-dsa2" in the manual for more information.


Noteworthy changes in version 1.4.3 (2006-04-03)
------------------------------------------------

    * If available, cURL-based keyserver helpers are built that can
      retrieve keys using HKP or any protocol that cURL supports
      (HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, FTPS, etc).  If cURL is not available, HKP
      and HTTP are still supported using a built-in cURL emulator.  To
      force building the old pre-cURL keyserver helpers, use the
      configure option --enable-old-keyserver-helpers.  Note that none
      of this affects finger or LDAP support, which are unchanged.
      Note also that a future version of GnuPG will remove the old
      keyserver helpers altogether.

    * Implemented Public Key Association (PKA) signature verification.
      This uses special DNS records and notation data to associate a
      mail address with an OpenPGP key to prove that mail coming from
      that address is legitimate without the need for a full trust
      path to the signing key.

    * When exporting subkeys, those specified with a key ID or
      fingerpint and the '!' suffix are now merged into one keyblock.

    * Added "gpg-zip", a program to create encrypted archives that can
      interoperate with PGP Zip.

    * Added support for signing subkey cross-certification "back
      signatures".  Requiring cross-certification to be present is
      currently off by default, but will be changed to on by default
      in the future, once more keys use it.  A new "cross-certify"
      command in the --edit-key menu can be used to update signing
      subkeys to have cross-certification.

    * The key cleaning options for --import-options and
      --export-options have been further polished.  "import-clean" and
      "export-clean" replace the older
      import-clean-sigs/import-clean-uids and
      export-clean-sigs/export-clean-uids option pairs.

    * New "minimize" command in the --edit-key menu removes everything
      that can be removed from a key, rendering it as small as
      possible.  There are corresponding "export-minimal" and
      "import-minimal" commands for --export-options and
      --import-options.

    * New --fetch-keys command to retrieve keys by specifying a URI.
      This allows direct key retrieval from a web page or other
      location that can be specified in a URI.  Available protocols
      are HTTP and finger, plus anything that cURL supplies, if built
      with cURL support.

    * Files containing several signed messages are not allowed any
      longer as there is no clean way to report the status of such
      files back to the caller.  To partly revert to the old behaviour
      the new option --allow-multisig-verification may be used.

    * The keyserver helpers can now handle keys in either ASCII armor
      or binary format.

    * New auto-key-locate option that takes an ordered list of methods
      to locate a key if it is not available at encryption time (-r or
      --recipient).  Possible methods include "cert" (use DNS CERT as
      per RFC2538bis, "pka" (use DNS PKA), "ldap" (consult the LDAP
      server for the domain in question), "keyserver" (use the
      currently defined keyserver), as well as arbitrary keyserver
      URIs that will be contacted for the key.

    * Able to retrieve keys using DNS CERT records as per RFC-4398.


Noteworthy changes in version 1.4.2 (2005-07-26)
------------------------------------------------

    * New command "verify" in the card-edit menu to display
      the Private-DO-3.  The Admin command has been enhanced to take
      the optional arguments "on", "off" and "verify".  The latter may
      be used to verify the Admin Pin without modifying data; this
      allows displaying the Private-DO-4 with the "list" command.

    * Rewrote large parts of the card code to optionally make use of a
      running gpg-agent.  If --use-agent is being used and a gpg-agent
      with enabled scdaemon is active, gpg will now divert all card
      operations to that daemon.  This is required because both,
      scdaemon and gpg require exclusive access to the card reader. By
      delegating the work to scdaemon, both can peacefully coexist and
      scdaemon is able to control the use of the reader.  Note that
      this requires at least gnupg 1.9.17.

    * Fixed a couple of problems with the card reader.

    * Command completion is now available in the --edit-key and
      --card-edit menus.  Filename completion is available at all
      filename prompts.  Note that completion is only available if the
      system provides a readline library.

    * New experimental HKP keyserver helper that uses the cURL
      library.  It is enabled via the configure option --with-libcurl
      like the other (also experimental) cURL helpers.

    * New key cleaning options that can be used to remove unusable
      (expired, revoked) signatures from a key.  This is available via
      the new "clean" command in --edit-key on a key by key basis, as
      well as via the import-clean-sigs/import-clean-uids and
      export-clean-sigs/export-clean-uids options for --import-options
      and --export-options.  These are currently off by default, and
      replace the import-unusable-sigs/export-unusable-sigs options
      from version 1.4.1.

    * New export option export-reset-subkey-passwd.

    * New option --limit-card-insert-tries.


Noteworthy changes in version 1.4.1 (2005-03-15)
------------------------------------------------

    * New --rfc2440-text option which controls how text is handled in
      signatures.  This is in response to some problems seen with
      certain PGP/MIME mail clients and GnuPG version 1.4.0.  More
      details about this are available at
      <http://lists.gnupg.org/pipermail/gnupg-users/2005-January/024408.html>.

    * New "import-unusable-sigs" and "export-unusable-sigs" tags for
      --import-options and --export-options.  These are off by default,
      which causes GnuPG to not import or export key signatures that
      are not usable (e.g. expired signatures).

    * New experimental HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, and FTPS keyserver helper
      that uses the cURL library <http://curl.haxx.se> to retrieve
      keys.  This is disabled by default, but may be enabled with the
      configure option --with-libcurl.  Without this option, the
      existing HTTP code is used for HTTP, and HTTPS, FTP, and FTPS
      are not supported.

    * When running a --card-status or --card-edit and a public key is
      available, missing secret key stubs will be created on the fly.
      Details of the key are listed too.

    * The implicit packet dumping in double verbose mode is now sent
      to stderr and not to stdout.

    * Added countermeasures against the Mister/Zuccherato CFB attack
      <http://eprint.iacr.org/2005/033>.

    * [W32] The algorithm for the default home directory changed:
      First we look at the environment variable GNUPGHOME, if this one
      is not set, we check whether the registry entry
      {HKCU,HKLM}\Software\GNU\GnuPG:HomeDir has been set. If this
      fails we use a GnuPG directory below the standard application
      data directory (APPDATA) of the current user. Only in the case
      that this directory cannot be determined, the old default of
      c:\gnupg will be used.  The option --homedir still overrides all
      of them.

    * [W32] The locale selection under Windows changed. You need to
      enter the locale in the registry at HKCU\Software\GNU\GnuPG:Lang. 
      For German you would use "de".  If it is not set, GnuPG falls
      back to HKLM.  The languages files "*.mo" are expected in a
      directory named "gnupg.nls" below the installation directory;
      that directory must be stored in the registry at the same key as
      above with the name "Install Directory".

    * Add new --edit-key command "bkuptocard" to allow restoring a
      card key from a backup.

    * The "fetch" command of --card-edit now retrieves the key using
      the default keyserver if no URL has been stored on the card.

    * New configure option --enable-noexecstack.


Noteworthy changes in version 1.4.0 (2004-12-16)
------------------------------------------------

    * See the file doc/highlights-1.4.txt for an overview of all
      changes in respect to the 1.2 series.


Noteworthy changes in version 1.3.93 (2004-12-14)
-------------------------------------------------

    * Ask the user to repeat a changed PIN.

    * Switched to automake 1.9.  Minor big fixes.

    
Noteworthy changes in version 1.3.92 (2004-10-28)
-------------------------------------------------
    
    * Added Russian man page. Thanks to Pawel I. Shajdo.

    * libiconv is now used to support other character sets other than
      UTF-8, Latin-1,-2 and KOI8-2.  The W32 version will only work
      correctly when iconv.dll is installed on the system.  A binary
      version is available at all GNU mirror sites under libiconv.
     
    * gettext for Windows has been simplified.  The MO files are now
      distributed UTF-8 encoded and gpg translates on the fly.


Noteworthy changes in version 1.3.91 (2004-10-15)
-------------------------------------------------

    * A new configure option --enable-selinux-support disallows
      processing of confidential files used by gpg (e.g. secring.gpg).
      This helps writing ACLs for the SELinux kernel.

    * Support for fetching keys via finger has been added.  This is
      useful for setting a preferred keyserver URL like
      "finger:wk@g10code.com".

    * Timeout support has been added to the keyserver helpers.  This
      allows users to set an upper limit on how long to wait for the
      keyserver before giving up.

    * New "direct" trust model where users can set key validity
      directly if they do not want to participate in the web of trust.

    * Minor bug fixes, code and string cleanups.


Noteworthy changes in version 1.3.90 (2004-10-01)
-------------------------------------------------

    * Readline support at all prompts is now available if the system
      provides a readline library.  The build time option
      --without-readline may be used to disable this feature.

    * Support for the OpenPGP smartcard is now enabled by default.
      Use the option --disable-card-support to build without support
      for smartcards. 

    * New command "addcardkey" in the key edit menu to add subkeys to
      a smartcard. New command "keytocard" to transfer a key to a smartcard.
      The serial number of the card is show in secret key listings.

    * -K may now be used as an alias for --list-secret-keys.      

    * HTTP Basic authentication is now supported for all HKP and HTTP
      keyserver functions, either through a proxy or via direct
      access.


Noteworthy changes in version 1.3.6 (2004-05-22)
------------------------------------------------

    * New --keyid-format option that selects short (99242560), long
      (DB698D7199242560), 0xshort (0x99242560), or 0xlong
      (0xDB698D7199242560) keyid displays.  This lets users tune the
      display to what they prefer.

    * The --list-options and --verify-options option
      "show-long-keyids" has been removed since --keyid-format
      obviates the need for them.

    * Support for the old quasi-1991 partial length encoding has been
      removed.

    * The --export-all and --export-options include-non-rfc options
      have been removed as superfluous since nonstandard V3 Elgamal
      sign+encrypt keys have been removed.

    * Preferred keyserver support has been added.  Users may set a
      preferred keyserver via the --edit-key command "keyserver".  If
      the --keyserver-option honor-keyserver-url is set (and it is by
      default), then the preferred keyserver is used when refreshing
      that key.

    * The --sig-keyserver-url option can be used to inform signature
      recipients where the signing key can be downloaded.  When
      verifying the signature, if the signing key is not present, and
      the keyserver options honor-keyserver-url and auto-key-retrieve
      are set, this URL will be used to retrieve the key.

    * Support for fetching keys via HTTP has been added.  This is
      mainly useful for setting a preferred keyserver URL like
      "http://www.jabberwocky.com/key.asc".

    * New --ask-cert-level/--no-ask-cert-level option to turn on and
      off the prompt for signature level when signing a key.  Defaults
      to off.

    * New --gpgconf-list command for internal use by the gpgconf
      utility from gnupg 1.9.x.


Noteworthy changes in version 1.3.5 (2004-02-26)
------------------------------------------------

    * New --min-cert-level option to disregard key signatures that are
      under a specified level.  Defaults to 2 (i.e. discard 0x11
      signatures).

    * New --max-output option to limit the amount of plaintext output
      generated by GnuPG.  This option can be used by programs which
      call GnuPG to process messages that may result in plaintext
      larger than the calling program is prepared to handle.  This is
      sometimes called a "Decompression Bomb".

    * New --list-config command for frontends and other programs that
      call GnuPG.  See doc/DETAILS for the specifics of this.

    * Some performance improvements with large keyrings.  See the
      build time option --enable-key-cache=SIZE in the README file for
      details.

    * Some portability fixes for the OpenBSD/i386, HPPA, and AIX
      platforms.

    * New keyserver-option "http-proxy" to specify which proxy to use
      in the config file without using environment variables.

    * Added support for storing, retrieving, and searching for keys in
      LDAP servers.  Note that this is different than the "LDAP
      keyserver" which was already (and remains) supported.

    * Added support for TLS and LDAPS session encryption for LDAP.

    * --show-session-key/--override-session-key now works with
      --symmetric messages.

    * The configure options --enable-rsa and --disable-rsa can now be
      used to enable or disable the RSA algorithm.  This can be useful
      for embedded use where space is tight.  --enable-minimal
      includes --disable-rsa.  RSA is enabled by default.

    * The last support for Elgamal sign+encrypt keys has been removed.


Noteworthy changes in version 1.3.4 (2003-11-27)
------------------------------------------------

    * Added support for BZIP2 compression.  This should be considered
      experimental, and is only available if the libbzip2 library
      <http://sources.redhat.com/bzip2/> is installed.

    * Added the ability to handle messages that can be decrypted with
      either a passphrase or a secret key.  These messages may be
      generated with --symmetric --encrypt or --symmetric --sign
      --encrypt.

    * The config file search has been enhanced to try for less
      specific filename matches before giving up.  For example,
      version 1.3.4 will try for gpg.conf-1.3.4, gpg.conf-1.3, and
      gpg.conf-1 before falling back to the regular gpg.conf file.

    * Fixed a format string bug in the HKP keyserver handler.

    * Support for Elgamal sign+encrypt keys has been removed.  Old
      signatures may still be verified, and existing encrypted
      messages may still be decrypted, but no new signatures may be
      issued by, and no new messages will be encrypted to, these keys.


Noteworthy changes in version 1.3.3 (2003-10-10)
------------------------------------------------

    * Basic support for the OpenPGP card.  New commands --card-status,
      --card-edit, --change-pin and the configuration options
      --reader-port, --ctapi-driver, --pcsc-driver, and --disable-ccid.

    * Full (read/write) support for the SHA-256 hash has been added.

    * Support for the TIGER/192 hash has been dropped.  This should
      not be interpreted as a statement as to the strength of
      TIGER/192 - rather, the upcoming revision to the OpenPGP
      standard removes support for several unused (or mostly unused)
      hashes.

    * Revoked or expired user IDs are now skipped when selecting keys
      for encryption.  Specifying a key by the key ID overrides this
      check and allows the selection of any key.

    * Note that --no-mangle-dos-filenames is now the default.  If you
      are upgrading from a 1.2.x version of GnuPG, and are running a
      very old version of Windows that has the 8.3 filename limit, you
      may need to change this.

    * Multiple "Comment:" lines in armored output are now allowed.

    * New --list-options option.  This option takes a list of
      arguments that allows the user to customize exactly what key
      listings (including the --edit-key listing) look like, enabling
      or disabling things such as photo display, policy URL, preferred
      keyserver URL, or notation display, long or short keyIDs,
      calculated validity for each user ID, etc.  See the manual for
      the complete list of list-options.

    * New --verify-options option.  This option takes a list of
      arguments that allows the user to customize exactly what happens
      during signature verification, enabling or disabling things such
      as photo display, policy URL, preferred keyserver URL, or
      notation display, long or short keyIDs, calculated validity for
      each user ID, etc.  See the manual for the complete list of
      verify-options.

    * New --sig-keyserver-url to embed a "where to get my key"
      subpacket into a signature.

    * The options --show-photos, --show-policy-url, --show-notation,
      and --show-keyring are all deprecated in favor of those
      arguments to --list-options and --verify-options.  The new
      method is more flexible since a user can specify (for example)
      showing photos during sig verification, but not in key listings.

    * The complete fingerprint of the key that made a given key
      certification is now available in the --with-colons output.  For
      technical reasons, this is only available when running with
      --no-sig-cache set.  See doc/DETAILS for the specifics of this.

    * IPv6 support for HKP keyserver access.  IPv6 for LDAP keyserver
      access is also supported, but is dependent on the LDAP library
      used.

    * To simplify running both the stable (1.2.x) and development
      (1.3.x) versions of GnuPG, the development version will try to
      load the options file gpg.conf-VERSION (e.g. gpg.conf-1.3.3 for
      this release) before falling back to the regular gpg.conf file.

    * Two new %-expandos for use in notation and policy URLs.  "%g"
      expands to the fingerprint of the key making the signature
      (which might be a subkey), and "%p" expands to the fingerprint
      of the primary key that owns the key making the signature.
 
    * New "tru" record in --with-colons --list-keys listings.  It
      shows the status of the trust database that was used to
      calculate the key validity in the listings.  See doc/DETAILS for
      the specifics of this.
 
    * New REVKEYSIG status tag for --status-fd.  It indicates a valid
      signature that was issued by a revoked key.  See doc/DETAILS for
      the specifics of this.

    * A number of portability changes to make building GnuPG on
      less-common platforms easier.


Noteworthy changes in version 1.3.2 (2003-05-27)
------------------------------------------------

    * New "--gnupg" option (set by default) that disables --openpgp,
      and the various --pgpX emulation options.  This replaces
      --no-openpgp, and --no-pgpX, and also means that GnuPG has
      finally grown a --gnupg option to make GnuPG act like GnuPG.

    * A bug in key validation has been fixed.  This bug only affects
      keys with more than one user ID (photo IDs do not count here),
      and results in all user IDs on a given key being treated with
      the validity of the most-valid user ID on that key.

    * Notation names that do not contain a '@' are no longer allowed
      unless --expert is set.  This is to help prevent pollution of
      the (as yet unused) IETF notation namespace.

    * Multiple trust models are now supported via the --trust-model
      option.  The options are "pgp" (web-of-trust plus trust
      signatures), "classic" (web-of-trust only), and "always"
      (identical to the --always-trust option).

    * The --personal-{cipher|digest|compression}-preferences are now
      consulted to get default algorithms before resorting to the
      last-ditch defaults of --s2k-cipher-algo, SHA1, and ZIP
      respectively.  This allows a user to set algorithms to use in a
      safe manner so they are used when legal to do so, without
      forcing them on for all messages.

    * New --primary-keyring option to designate the keyring that the
      user wants new keys imported into.

    * --s2k-digest-algo is now used for all password mangling.
      Earlier versions used both --s2k-digest-algo and --digest-algo
      for passphrase mangling.

    * Handling of --hidden-recipient or --throw-keyid messages is now
      easier - the user only needs to give their passphrase once, and
      GnuPG will try it against all of the available secret keys.

    * Care is taken to prevent compiler optimization from removing
      memory wiping code.

    * New option --no-mangle-dos-filenames so that filenames are not
      truncated in the W32 version.

    * A "convert-from-106" script has been added.  This is a simple
      script that automates the conversion from a 1.0.6 or earlier
      version of GnuPG to a 1.0.7 or later version.

    * Disabled keys are now skipped when selecting keys for
      encryption.  If you are using the --with-colons key listings to
      detect disabled keys, please see doc/DETAILS for a minor format
      change in this release.

    * Minor trustdb changes to make the trust calculations match
      common usage.

    * New command "revuid" in the --edit-key menu to revoke a user ID.
      This is a simpler interface to the old method (which still
      works) of revoking the user ID self-signature.

    * Status VALIDSIG does now also print the primary key's
      fingerprint, as well as the signature version, pubkey algorithm,
      hash algorithm, and signature class.

    * Add read-only support for the SHA-256 hash, and optional
      read-only support for the SHA-384 and SHA-512 hashes.

    * New option --enable-progress-filter for use with frontends.

    * DNS SRV records are used in HKP keyserver lookups to allow
      administrators to load balance and select keyserver ports
      automatically.  This is as specified in
      draft-shaw-openpgp-hkp-00.txt.

    * When using the "keyid!" syntax during a key export, only that
      specified key is exported.  If the key in question is a subkey,
      the primary key plus only that subkey is exported.

    * configure --disable-xxx options to disable individual algorithms
      at build time.  This can be used to build a smaller gpg binary
      for embedded uses where space is tight.  See the README file for
      the algorithms that can be used with this option, or use
      --enable-minimal to build the smallest gpg possible (disables
      all optional algorithms, disables keyserver access, and disables
      photo IDs).

    * The keyserver no-modify flag on a key can now be displayed and
      modified.

    * Note that the TIGER/192 digest algorithm is in the process of
      being dropped from the OpenPGP standard.  While this release of
      GnuPG still contains it, it is disabled by default.  To ensure
      you will still be able to use your messages with future versions
      of GnuPG and other OpenPGP programs, please do not use this
      algorithm.


Noteworthy changes in version 1.3.1 (2002-11-12)
------------------------------------------------

    * Trust signature support.  This is based on the Maurer trust
      model where a user can specify the trust level along with the
      signature with multiple levels so users can delegate
      certification ability to other users, possibly restricted by a
      regular expression on the user ID.  Note that full trust
      signature support requires a regular expression parsing library.
      The regexp code from glibc 2.3.1 is included for those platforms
      that don't have working regexp functions available.  The
      configure option --disable-regex may be used to disable any
      regular expression code, which will make GnuPG ignore any trust
      signature with a regular expression included.

    * Two new commands --hidden-recipient (-R) and --hidden-encrypt-to
      encrypt to a user, but hide the identity of that user.  This is
      the same functionality as --throw-keyid, but can be used on a
      per-user basis.

    * Full algorithm names (e.g. "3DES", "SHA1", "ZIP") can now be
      used interchangeably with the short algorithm names (e.g. "S2",
      "H2", "Z1") anywhere algorithm names are used in GnuPG.


Noteworthy changes in version 1.3.0 (2002-10-18)
------------------------------------------------

    * The last piece of internal keyserver support has been removed,
      and now all keyserver access is done via the keyserver plugins.
      There is also a newer keyserver protocol used between GnuPG and
      the plugins, so plugins from earlier versions of GnuPG may not
      work properly.

    * The HKP keyserver plugin supports the new machine-readable key
      listing format for those keyservers that provide it.

    * When using a HKP keyserver with multiple DNS records (such as
      wwwkeys.pgp.net which has the addresses of multiple servers
      around the world), try all records until one succeeds.  Note
      that it depends on the LDAP library used whether the LDAP
      keyserver plugin does this as well.

    * The library dependencies for OpenLDAP seem to change fairly
      frequently, and GnuPG's configure script cannot guess all the
      combinations.  Use ./configure LDAPLIBS="-L libdir -l libs" to
      override the script and use the libraries selected.

    * Secret keys generated with --export-secret-subkeys are now
      indicated in key listings with a '#' after the "sec", and in
      --with-colons listings by showing no capabilities (no lowercase
      characters).

    * --trusted-key has been un-obsoleted, as it is useful for adding
      ultimately trusted keys from the config file.  It is identical
      to using --edit and "trust" to change a key to ultimately
      trusted.

    * Translations other than de are no longer distributed with the
      development branch.  This is due to the frequent text changes
      during development, which cause the translations to rapidly go
      out of date.


Noteworthy changes in version 1.1.92 (2002-09-11)
-------------------------------------------------

    * [IMPORTANT] The default configuration file is now
      ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf.  If an old ~/.gnupg/options is found it will
      still be used.  This change is required to have a more
      consistent naming scheme with forthcoming tools.

    * The use of MDCs have increased.  A MDC will be used if the
      recipients directly request it, if the recipients have AES,
      AES192, AES256, or TWOFISH in their cipher preferences, or if
      the chosen cipher has a blocksize not equal to 64 bits
      (currently this is also AES, AES192, AES256, and TWOFISH).

    * GnuPG will no longer automatically disable compression when
      processing an already-compressed file unless a MDC is being
      used.  This is to give the message a certain amount of
      resistance to the chosen-ciphertext attack while communicating
      with other programs (most commonly PGP earlier than version 7.x)
      that do not support MDCs.

    * The option --interactive now has the desired effect when
      importing keys.

    * The file permission and ownership checks on files have been
      clarified.  Specifically, the homedir (usually ~/.gnupg) is
      checked to protect everything within it.  If the user specifies
      keyrings outside this homedir, they are presumed to be shared
      keyrings and therefore *not* checked.  Configuration files
      specified with the --options option and the IDEA cipher
      extension specified with --load-extension are checked, along
      with their enclosing directories.

    * The configure option --with-static-rnd=auto allows to build gpg
      with all available entropy gathering modules included.  At
      runtime the best usable one will be selected from the list
      linux, egd, unix.  This is also the default for systems lacking
      a /dev/random device.

    * The default character set is now taken from the current locale;
      it can still be overridden by the --charset option.  Using the
      option -vvv shows the used character set.

    * [REMOVED] --emulate-checksum-bug and --emulate-3des-s2k-bug have
      been removed.


Noteworthy changes in version 1.1.91 (2002-08-04)
-------------------------------------------------

    * All modules are now linked statically; the --load-extension
      option is in general not useful anymore.  The only exception is
      to specify the deprecated idea cipher.

    * The IDEA plugin has changed.  Previous versions of the IDEA
      plugin will no longer work with GnuPG.  However, the current
      version of the plugin will work with earlier GnuPG versions.

    * When using --batch with one of the --delete-key commands, the
      key must be specified by fingerprint.  See the man page for
      details.

    * There are now various ways to restrict the ability GnuPG has to
      exec external programs (for the keyserver helpers or photo ID
      viewers).  Read the README file for the complete list.

    * New export option to leave off attribute packets (photo IDs)
      during export.  This is useful when exporting to HKP keyservers
      which do not understand attribute packets.

    * New import option to repair during import the HKP keyserver
      mangling multiple subkeys bug.  Note that this cannot completely
      repair the damaged key as some crucial data is removed by the
      keyserver, but it does at least give you back one subkey.  This
      is on by default for keyserver --recv-keys, and off by default
      for regular --import.

    * The keyserver helper programs now live in
      /usr/[local/]libexec/gnupg by default.  If you are upgrading
      from 1.0.7, you might want to delete your old copies in
      /usr/[local/]bin.  If you use an OS that does not use libexec
      for whatever reason, use configure --libexecdir=/usr/local/lib
      to place the keyserver helpers there.

    * The LDAP keyserver handler now works properly with very old
      (version 1) LDAP keyservers.


Noteworthy changes in version 1.1.90 (2002-07-01)
-------------------------------------------------

    * New commands: --personal-cipher-preferences,
      --personal-digest-preferences, and
      --personal-compress-preferences allow the user to specify which
      algorithms are to be preferred.  Note that this does not permit
      using an algorithm that is not present in the recipient's
      preferences (which would violate the OpenPGP standard).  This
      just allows sorting the preferences differently.

    * New "group" command to refer to several keys with one name.

    * A warning is issued if the user forces the use of an algorithm
      that is not listed in the recipient's preferences.

    * Full revocation key (aka "designated revoker") support.

    * The preferred hash algorithms on a key are consulted when
      encrypting a signed message to that key.  Note that this is
      disabled by default by a SHA1 preference in
      --personal-digest-preferences.

    * --cert-digest-algo allows the user to specify the hash algorithm
      to use when signing a key rather than the default SHA1 (or MD5
      for PGP2 keys).  Do not use this feature unless you fully
      understand the implications of this.

    * --pgp7 mode automatically sets all necessary options to ensure
      that the resulting message will be usable by a user of PGP 7.x.

    * New --attribute-fd command for frontends and scripts to get the
      contents of attribute packets (i.e. photos)

    * In expert mode, the user can now re-sign a v3 key with a v4
      self-signature.  This does not change the v3 key into a v4 key,
      but it does allow the user to use preferences, primary ID flags,
      etc.

    * Significantly improved photo ID support on non-unixlike
      platforms.

    * The version number has jumped ahead to 1.1.90 to skip over the
      old version 1.1 and to get ready for the upcoming 1.2.

    * ElGamal sign and encrypt is not anymore allowed in the key
      generation dialog unless in expert mode.  RSA sign and encrypt
      has been added with the same restrictions.

    * [W32] Keyserver access does work with Windows NT.


Noteworthy changes in version 1.0.7 (2002-04-29)
------------------------------------------------

    * Secret keys are now stored and exported in a new format which
      uses SHA-1 for integrity checks.  This format renders the
      Rosa/Klima attack useless.  Other OpenPGP implementations might
      not yet support this, so the option --simple-sk-checksum creates
      the old vulnerable format.

    * The default cipher algorithm for encryption is now CAST5,
      default hash algorithm is SHA-1.  This will give us better
      interoperability with other OpenPGP implementations.

    * Symmetric encrypted messages now use a fixed file size if
      possible.  This is a tradeoff: it breaks PGP 5, but fixes PGP 2,
      6, and 7.  Note this was only an issue with RFC-1991 style
      symmetric messages.

    * Photographic user ID support.  This uses an external program to
      view the images.

    * Enhanced keyserver support via keyserver "plugins".  GnuPG comes
      with plugins for the NAI LDAP keyserver as well as the HKP email
      keyserver.  It retains internal support for the HKP HTTP
      keyserver.

    * Nonrevocable signatures are now supported.  If a user signs a
      key nonrevocably, this signature cannot be taken back so be
      careful!

    * Multiple signature classes are usable when signing a key to
      specify how carefully the key information (fingerprint, photo
      ID, etc) was checked.

    * --pgp2 mode automatically sets all necessary options to ensure
      that the resulting message will be usable by a user of PGP 2.x.

    * --pgp6 mode automatically sets all necessary options to ensure
      that the resulting message will be usable by a user of PGP 6.x.

    * Signatures may now be given an expiration date.  When signing a
      key with an expiration date, the user is prompted whether they
      want their signature to expire at the same time.

    * Revocation keys (designated revokers) are now supported if
      present.  There is currently no way to designate new keys as
      designated revokers.

    * Permissions on the .gnupg directory and its files are checked
      for safety.

    * --expert mode enables certain silly things such as signing a
      revoked user id, expired key, or revoked key.

    * Some fixes to build cleanly under Cygwin32.

    * New tool gpgsplit to split OpenPGP data formats into packets.

    * New option --preserve-permissions.

    * Subkeys created in the future are not used for encryption or
      signing unless the new option --ignore-valid-from is used.

    * Revoked user-IDs are not listed unless signatures are listed too
      or we are in verbose mode.

    * There is no default comment string with ascii armors anymore
      except for revocation certificates and --enarmor mode.

    * The command "primary" in the edit menu can be used to change the
      primary UID, "setpref" and "updpref" can be used to change the
      preferences.

    * Fixed the preference handling; since 1.0.5 they were erroneously
      matched against against the latest user ID and not the given one.

    * RSA key generation.

    * Merged Stefan's patches for RISC OS in.  See comments in
      scripts/build-riscos. 

    * It is now possible to sign and conventional encrypt a message (-cs).

    * The MDC feature flag is supported and can be set by using
      the "updpref" edit command.

    * The status messages GOODSIG and BADSIG are now returning the primary
      UID, encoded using %XX escaping (but with spaces left as spaces,
      so that it should not break too much)

    * Support for GDBM based keyrings has been removed.

    * The entire keyring management has been revamped.

    * The way signature stati are store has changed so that v3
      signatures can be supported. To increase the speed of many
      operations for existing keyrings you can use the new
      --rebuild-keydb-caches command.

    * The entire key validation process (trustdb) has been revamped.
      See the man page entries for --update-trustdb, --check-trustdb
      and --no-auto-check-trustdb.

    * --trusted-keys is again obsolete, --edit can be used to set the
      ownertrust of any key to ultimately trusted.

    * A subkey is never used to sign keys.

    * Read only keyrings are now handled as expected.


Noteworthy changes in version 1.0.6 (2001-05-29)
------------------------------------------------

    * Security fix for a format string bug in the tty code.

    * Fixed format string bugs in all PO files. 

    * Removed Russian translation due to too many bugs.  The FTP
      server has an unofficial but better translation in the contrib
      directory.

    * Fixed expire time calculation and keyserver access.

    * The usual set of minor bug fixes and enhancements.

    * non-writable keyrings are now correctly handled.


Noteworthy changes in version 1.0.5 (2001-04-29)
------------------------------------------------

    * WARNING: The semantics of --verify have changed to address a
      problem with detached signature detection. --verify now ignores
      signed material given on stdin unless this is requested by using
      a "-" as the name for the file with the signed material.  Please
      check all your detached signature handling applications and make
      sure that they don't pipe the signed material to stdin without
      using a filename together with "-" on the the command line.

    * WARNING: Corrected hash calculation for input data larger than
      512M - it was just wrong, so you might notice bad signature in
      some very big files.  It may be wise to keep an old copy of
      GnuPG around.

    * Secret keys are no longer imported unless you use the new option
      --allow-secret-key-import.  This is a kludge and future versions will
      handle it in another way.

    * New command "showpref" in the --edit-key menu to show an easier
      to understand preference listing.

    * There is now the notation of a primary user ID.  For example, it
      is printed with a signature verification as the first user ID;
      revoked user IDs are not printed there anymore.  In general the
      primary user ID is the one with the latest self-signature.

    * New --charset=utf-8 to bypass all internal conversions.

    * Large File Support (LFS) is now working.

    * New options: --ignore-crc-error, --no-sig-create-check, 
      --no-sig-cache, --fixed-list-mode, --no-expensive-trust-checks,
      --enable-special-filenames and --use-agent.  See man page.

    * New command --pipemode, which can be used to run gpg as a
      co-process.  Currently only the verification of detached
      signatures are working.  See doc/DETAILS.

    * Keyserver support for the W32 version.

    * Rewritten key selection code so that GnuPG can better cope with
      multiple subkeys, expire dates and so.  The drawback is that it
      is slower.

    * A whole lot of bug fixes.

    * The verification status of self-signatures are now cached. To
      increase the speed of key list operations for existing keys you
      can do the following in your GnuPG homedir (~/.gnupg):
         cp pubring.gpg pubring.gpg.save && gpg --export-all >x && \
         rm pubring.gpg && gpg --import x
      Only v4 keys (i.e not the old RSA keys) benefit from this caching.

    * New translations: Estonian, Turkish.


Noteworthy changes in version 1.0.4 (2000-10-17)
------------------------------------------------

    * Fixed a serious bug which could lead to false signature verification
      results when more than one signature is fed to gpg.  This is the
      primary reason for releasing this version.

    * New utility gpgv which is a stripped down version of gpg to
      be used to verify signatures against a list of trusted keys.

    * Rijndael (AES) is now supported and listed with top preference.

    * --with-colons now works with --print-md[s].

Noteworthy changes in version 1.0.3 (2000-09-18)
------------------------------------------------

    * Fixed problems with piping to/from other MS-Windows software

    * Expiration time of the primary key can be changed again.

    * Revoked user IDs are now marked in the output of --list-key

    * New options --show-session-key and --override-session-key
      to help the British folks to somewhat minimize the danger
      of this Orwellian RIP bill.

    * New options --merge-only and --try-all-secrets.

    * New configuration option --with-egd-socket.

    * The --trusted-key option is back after it left us with 0.9.5
     
    * RSA is supported. Key generation does not yet work but will come
      soon. 
    
    * CAST5 and SHA-1 are now the default algorithms to protect the key
      and for symmetric-only encryption. This should solve a couple
      of compatibility problems because the old algorithms are optional
      according to RFC2440

    * Twofish and MDC enhanced encryption is now used.  PGP 7 supports 
      this.  Older versions of GnuPG don't support it, so they should be
      upgraded to at least 1.0.2
      

Noteworthy changes in version 1.0.2 (2000-07-12)
----------------------------------------------

    * Fixed expiration handling of encryption keys.

    * Add an experimental feature to do unattended key generation.

    * The user is now asked for the reason of revocation as required
      by the new OpenPGP draft.

    * There is a ~/.gnupg/random_seed file now which saves the
      state of the internal RNG and increases system performance
      somewhat.  This way the full entropy source is only used in
      cases were it is really required.
      Use the option --no-random-seed-file to disable this feature.

    * New options --ignore-time-conflict and --lock-never.

    * Some fixes for the W32 version.

    * The entropy.dll is not anymore used by the W32 version but replaced
      by code derived from Cryptlib.

    * Encryption is now much faster: About 2 times for 1k bit keys
      and 8 times for 4k keys.

    * New encryption keys are generated in a way which allows a much
      faster decryption.

    * New command --export-secret-subkeys which outputs the
      the _primary_ key with it's secret parts deleted.  This is
      useful for automated decryption/signature creation as it
      allows to keep the real secret primary key offline and
      thereby protecting the key certificates and allowing to
      create revocations for the subkeys.  See the FAQ for a
      procedure to install such secret keys.

    * Keygeneration now writes to the first writeable keyring or
      as default to the one in the homedirectory.  Prior versions
      ignored all --keyring options.

    * New option --command-fd to take user input from a file descriptor;
      to be used with --status-fd by software which uses GnuPG as a backend.

    * There is a new status PROGRESS which is used to show progress during
      key generation.

    * Support for the new MDC encryption packets.  To create them either
      --force-mdc must be use or cipher algorithm with a blocksize other
      than 64 bits is to be used.  --openpgp currently disables MDC packets
      entirely.  This option should not yet be used.

    * New option --no-auto-key-retrieve to disable retrieving of
      a missing public key from a keyserver, when a keyserver has been set.

    * Danish translation

Noteworthy changes in version 1.0.1 (1999-12-16)
-----------------------------------

    * New command --verify-files.  New option --fast-list-mode.

    * $http_proxy is now used when --honor-http-proxy is set.

    * Fixed some minor bugs and the problem with conventional encrypted
      packets which did use the gpg v3 partial length headers.

    * Add Indonesian and Portugese translations.

    * Fixed a bug with symmetric-only encryption using the non-default 3DES.
      The option --emulate-3des-s2k-bug may be used to decrypt documents
      which have been encrypted this way; this should be done immediately
      as this workaround will be remove in 1.1

    * Can now handle (but not display) PGP's photo IDs. I don't know the
      format of that packet but after stripping a few bytes from the start
      it looks like a JPEG (at least my test data).  Handling of this
      package is required because otherwise it would mix up the
      self signatures and you can't import those keys.

    * Passing non-ascii user IDs on the commandline should now work in all
      cases.

    * New keys are now generated with an additional preference to Blowfish.

    * Removed the GNU Privacy Handbook from the distribution as it will go
      into a separate one.


Noteworthy changes in version 1.0.0 (1999-09-07)
-----------------------------------

    * Add a very preliminary version of the GNU Privacy Handbook to
      the distribution (lynx doc/gph/index.html).

    * Changed the version number to GnuPG 2001 ;-)


Noteworthy changes in version 0.9.11
------------------------------------

    * UTF-8 strings are now correctly printed (if --charset is set correctly).
      Output of --with-colons remains C-style escaped UTF-8.

    * Workaround for a problem with PGP 5 detached signature in textmode.

    * Fixed a problem when importing new subkeys (duplicated signatures).

Noteworthy changes in version 0.9.10
------------------------------------

    * Some strange new options to help pgpgpg

    * Cleaned up the dox a bit.


Noteworthy changes in version 0.9.9
-----------------------------------

    * New options --[no-]utf8-strings.

    * New edit-menu commands "enable" and "disable" for entire keys.

    * You will be asked for a filename if gpg cannot deduce one.

    * Changes to support libtool which is needed for the development
      of libgcrypt.

    * New script tools/lspgpot to help transferring assigned
      trustvalues from PGP to GnuPG.

    * New commands --lsign-key and made --sign-key a shortcut for --edit
      and sign.

    * New options (#122--126 ;-) --[no-]default-recipient[-self],
      --disable-{cipher,pubkey}-algo. See the man page.

    * Enhanced info output in case of multiple recipients and fixed exit code.

    * New option --allow-non-selfsigned-uid to work around a problem with
      the German IN way of separating signing and encryption keys.


Noteworthy changes in version 0.9.8
-----------------------------------

    * New subcommand "delsig" in the edit menu.

    * The name of the output file is not anymore the one which is
      embedded in the processed message, but the used filename with
      the extension stripped.  To revert to the old behaviour you can
      use the option --use-embedded-filename.

    * Another hack to cope with pgp2 generated detached signatures.

    * latin-2 character set works (--charset=iso-8859-2).

    * New option --with-key-data to list the public key parameters.
      New option -N to insert notations and a --set-policy-url.
      A couple of other options to allow reseting of options.

    * Better support for HPUX.


Noteworthy changes in version 0.9.7
-----------------------------------

    * Add some work arounds for a bugs in pgp 2 which led to bad signatures
      when used with canonical texts in some cases.

    * Enhanced some status outputs.

Noteworthy changes in version 0.9.6
-----------------------------------

    * Twofish is now statically linked by default. The experimental 128 bit
      version is now disabled.	Full support will be available as soon as
      the OpenPGP WG has decided on an interpretation of rfc2440.

    * Dropped support for the ancient Blowfish160 which is not OpenPGP.

    * Merged gpgm and gpg into one binary.

    * Add "revsig" and "revkey" commands to the edit menu.  It is now
      possible to revoke signature and subkeys.


Noteworthy changes in version 0.9.5
-----------------------------------

    * New command "lsign" in the keyedit menu to create non-exportable
      signatures.  Removed --trusted-keys option.

    * A bunch of changes to the key validation code.

    * --list-trust-path now has an optional --with-colons format.

    * New command --recv-keys to import keys from an keyserver.


Noteworthy changes in version 0.9.4
-----------------------------------

    * New configure option --enable-static-rnd=[egd|linux|unix|none]
      to select a random gathering module for static linking.

    * The original text is now verbatim copied to a cleartext signed message.

    * Bugfixes but there are still a couple of bugs.


Noteworthy changes in version 0.9.3
-----------------------------------

    * Changed the internal design of getkey which now allows a
      efficient lookup of multiple keys and add a word match mode.

    * New options --[no-]encrypt-to.

    * Some changes to the configure stuff.  Switched to automake 1.4.
      Removed intl/ from CVS, autogen.sh now uses gettextize.

    * Preferences now include Twofish. Removed preference to Blowfish with
      a special hack to suppress the "not listed in preferences" warning;
      this is to allow us to switch completely to Twofish in the near future.

    * Changed the locking stuff.

    * Print all user ids of a good signature.


Noteworthy changes in version 0.9.2
-----------------------------------

    * add some additional time warp checks.

    * Option --keyserver and command --send-keys to utilize HKP servers.

    * Upgraded to zlib 1.1.3 and fixed an inflate bug

    * More cleanup on the cleartext signatures.


Noteworthy changes in version 0.9.1
-----------------------------------

    * Polish language support.

    * When querying the passphrase, the key ID of the primary key is
      displayed along with the one of the used secondary key.

    * Fixed a bug occurring when decrypting pgp 5 encrypted messages,
      fixed an infinite loop bug in the 3DES code and in the code
      which looks for trusted signatures.

    * Fixed a bug in the mpi library which caused signatures not to
      compare okay.

    * Rewrote the handling of cleartext signatures; the code is now
      better maintainable (I hope so).

    * New status output VALIDSIG only for valid signatures together
      with the fingerprint of the signer's key.


Noteworthy changes in version 0.9.0
-----------------------------------

    * --export does now only exports rfc2440 compatible keys; the
      old behaviour is available with --export-all.
      Generation of v3 ElGamal (sign and encrypt) keys is not longer
      supported.

    * Fixed the uncompress bug.

    * Rewrote the rndunix module. There are two environment variables
      used for debugging now: GNUPG_RNDUNIX_DBG give the file to write
      debugging information (use "-" for stdout) and if GNUPG_RNDUNIX_DBGALL
      is set, all programs which are only tried are also printed.

    * New option --escape-from-lines to "dash-escape" "From " lines to
      prevent mailers to change them to ">From ".  This is not enabled by
      default because it is not in compliance with rfc2440 - however, you
      should turn it on.


Noteworthy changes in version 0.4.5
-----------------------------------

    * The keyrings and the trustdb is now locked, so that
      other GnuPG processes won't damage these files.  You
      may want to put the option --lock-once into your options file.

    * The latest self-signatures are now used; this enables --import
      to see updated preferences etc.

    * Import of subkeys should now work.

    * Random gathering modules may now be loaded as extensions. Add
      such a module for most Unices but it is very experimental!

    * Brazilian language support.


Noteworthy changes in version 0.4.4
-----------------------------------

    * Fixed the way the key expiration time is stored. If you have
      an expiration time on your key you should fix it with --edit-key
      and the command "expire".  I apologize for this inconvenience.

    * Add option --charset to support "koi8-r" encoding of user ids.
      (Not yet tested).

    * Preferences should now work again. You should run
      "gpgm --check-trustdb \*" to rebuild all preferences.

    * Checking of certificates should now work but this needs a lot
      of testing.  Key validation values are now cached in the
      trustdb; they should be recalculated as needed, but you may
      use --check-trustdb or --update-trustdb to do this.

    * Spanish translation by Urko Lusa.

    * Patch files are from now on signed.  See the man page
      for the new option --not-dash-escaped.

    * New syntax: --edit-key <userID> [<commands>]
      If you run it without --batch the commands are executed and then
      you are put into normal mode unless you use "quit" or "save" as
      one of the commands.  When in batch mode, the program quits after
      the last command, so you have to use "save" if you did some changes.
      It does not yet work completely, but may be used to list so the
      keys etc.


Noteworthy changes in version 0.4.3
-----------------------------------

    * Fixed the gettext configure bug.

    * Kludge for RSA keys: keyid and length of a RSA key are
      correctly reported, but you get an error if you try to use
      this key (If you do not have the non-US version).

    * Experimental support for keyrings stored in a GDBM database.
      This is *much* faster than a standard keyring.  You will notice
      that the import gets slower with time; the reason is that all
      new keys are used to verify signatures of previous inserted
      keys.  Use "--keyring gnupg-gdbm:<name-of-gdbm-file>".  This is
      not (yet) supported for secret keys.

    * A Russian language file in the distribution (alternatives are in
      the contrib directory of the FTP servers)

    * commandline option processing now works as expected for GNU programs
      with the exception that you can't mix options and normal arguments.

    * Now --list-key lists all matching keys.  This is needed in some
      other places too.


Noteworthy changes in version 0.4.2
-----------------------------------

    * This is only a snapshot: There are still a few bugs.

    * Fixed this huge memory leak.

    * Redesigned the trust database:  You should run "gpgm --check-trustdb".
      New command --update-trustdb, which adds new key from the public
      keyring into your trustdb

    * Fixed a bug in the armor code, leading to invalid packet errors.
      (a workaround for this was to use --no-armor).  The shorten line
      length (64 instead of 72) fixes a problem with pgp5 and keyservers.

    * comment packets are not anymore generated. "--export" filters
      them out.  One Exception:  The comment packets in a secret keyring
      are still used because they carry the factorization of the public
      prime product.

    * --import now only looks for KEYBLOCK headers, so you can now simply
      remove the "- " in front of such a header if someone accidently signed
      such a message or the keyblock is part of a cleartext signed message.

    * --with-colons now lists the key expiration time and not anymore
      the valid period.

    * Some keyblocks created with old releases have a wrong sequence
      of packets, so that the keyservers don't accept these keys.
      Simply using "--edit-key" fixes the problem.

    * New option --force-v3-sigs to generate signed messages which are
      compatible to PGP 5.

    * Add some code to support DLD (for non ELF systems) - but this is
      not tested because my BSD box is currently broken.

    * New command "expire" in the edit-key menu.



Noteworthy changes in version 0.4.1
-----------------------------------
    * A secondary key is used when the primary key is specified but cannot
      be used for the operation (if it is a sign-only key).

    * GNUPG can now handle concatenated armored messages:  There is still a
      bug if different kinds of messages are mixed.

    * Iterated+Salted passphrases now work.  If want to be sure that PGP5
      is able to handle them you may want to use the options
	"--s2k-mode 3 --s2k-cipher-algo cast5 --s2k-digest-algo sha1"
      when changing a passphrase.

    * doc/OpenPGP talks about OpenPGP compliance, doc/HACKING gives
      a few hints about the internal structure.

    * Checked gnupg against the August 1998 draft (07) and I believe
      it is in compliance with this document (except for one point).

    * Fixed some bugs in the import merging code and rewrote some
      code for the trustdb.


Noteworthy changes in version 0.4.0
-----------------------------------
    * Triple DES is now supported.  Michael Roth did this piece of
      needed work.  We have now all the coded needed to be OpenPGP
      compliant.

    * Added a simple rpm spec file (see INSTALL).

    * detached and armored signatures are now using "PGP SIGNATURE",
      except when --rfc1991 is used.

    * All times which are not in the yyyy-mm-dd format are now printed
      in local time.


Noteworthy changes in version 0.3.5
-----------------------------------
    * New option --throw-keyid to create anonymous enciphered messages.
      If gpg detects such a message it tires all available secret keys
      in turn so decode it.  This is a gnupg extension and not in OpenPGP
      but it has been discussed there and afaik some products use this
      scheme too (Suggested by Nimrod Zimmerman).

    * Fixed a bug with 5 byte length headers.

    * --delete-[secret-]key is now also available in gpgm.

    * cleartext signatures are not anymore converted to LF only.

    * Fixed a trustdb problem.	Run "gpgm --check-trustdb" to fix old
      trust dbs.

    * Building in another directory should now work.

    * Weak key detection mechanism (Niklas Hernaeus).


Noteworthy changes in version 0.3.4
-----------------------------------
    * New options --comment and --set-filename; see g10/OPTIONS

    * yes/no, y/n localized.

    * Fixed some bugs.

Noteworthy changes in version 0.3.3
-----------------------------------
    * IMPORTANT: I found yet another bug in the way the secret keys
      are encrypted - I did it the way pgp 2.x did it, but OpenPGP
      and pgp 5.x specify another (in some aspects simpler) method.
      To convert your secret keys you have to do this:
	1. Build the new release but don't install it and keep
	   a copy of the old program.
	2. Disable the network, make sure that you are the only
	   user, be sure that there are no Trojan horses etc ....
	3. Use your old gpg (version 0.3.[12]) and set the
	   passphrases of ALL your secret keys to empty!
	   (gpg --change-passphrase your-user-id).
	4. Save your ownertrusts (see the next point)
	5. rm ~/.gnupg/trustdb.gpg
	6. install the new version of gpg (0.3.3)
	7. For every secret key call "gpg --edit-key your-user-id",
	   enter "passwd" at the prompt, follow the instructions and
	   change your password back, enter "save" to store it.
	8. Restore the ownertrust (see next point).

    * The format of the trust database has changed; you must delete
      the old one, so gnupg can create a new one.
      IMPORTANT: Use version 0.3.[12] to save your assigned ownertrusts
      ("gpgm --list-ownertrust >saved-trust"); then build this new version
      and restore the ownertrust with this new version
      ("gpgm --import-ownertrust saved-trust").  Please note that
      --list-ownertrust has been renamed to --export-ownertrust in this
      release and it does now only export defined ownertrusts.

    * The command --edit-key now provides a commandline driven menu
      which can be used for various tasks.  --sign-key is only an
      an alias to --edit-key and maybe removed in future: use the
      command "sign" of this new menu - you can select which user ids
      you want to sign.

    * Alternate user ids can now be created an signed.

    * Owner trust values can now be changed with --edit-key (trust)

    * GNUPG can now run as a coprocess; this enables sophisticated
      frontends.  tools/shmtest.c is a simple sample implementation.
      This needs some more work: all tty_xxx() are to be replaced
      by cpr_xxx() and some changes in the display logics is needed.

    * Removed options --gen-prime and --gen-random.

    * Removed option --add-key; use --edit-key instead.

    * Removed option --change-passphrase; use --edit-key instead.

    * Signatures are now checked even if the output file could not
      be created. Command "--verify" tries to find the detached data.

    * gpg now disables core dumps.

    * compress and symmetric cipher preferences are now used.
      Because there is no 3DES yet, this is replaced by Blowfish.

    * We have added the Twofish as an experimental cipher algorithm.
      Many thanks to Matthew Skala for doing this work.
      Twofish is the AES submission from Schneier et al.; see
      "www.counterpane.com/twofish.html" for more information.

    * Started with a help system: If you enter a question mark at some
      prompt; you should get a specific help for this prompt.

    * There is no more backup copy of the secret keyring.

    * A lot of new bugs. I think this release is not as stable as
      the previous one.


Noteworthy changes in version 0.3.2
-----------------------------------
    * Fixed some bugs when using --textmode (-seat)

    * Now displays the trust status of a positive verified message.

    * Keyrings are now scanned in the sequence they are added with
      --[secret-]keyring.  Note that the default keyring is implicitly
      added as the very first one unless --no-default-keyring is used.

    * Fixed setuid and dlopen bug.

Noteworthy changes in version 0.3.1
-----------------------------------
    * Partial headers are now written in the OpenPGP format if
      a key in a v4 packet is used.

    * Removed some unused options, removed the gnupg.sig stuff.

    * Key lookup by name now returns a key which can be used for
      the desired action.

    * New options --list-ownertrust (gpgm) to make a backup copy
      of the ownertrust values you assigned.

    * clear signature headers are now in compliance with OpenPGP.

Noteworthy changes in version 0.3.0
-----------------------------------

    * New option --emulate-checksum-bug.  If your passphrase does not
      work anymore, use this option and --change-passphrase to rewrite
      your passphrase.

    * More complete v4 key support: Preferences and expiration time
      is set into the self signature.

    * Key generation defaults to DSA/ElGamal keys, so that new keys are
      interoperable with pgp5

    * DSA key generation is faster and key generation does not anymore
      remove entropy from the random generator (the primes are public
      parameters, so there is really no need for a cryptographic secure
      prime number generator which we had used).

    * A complete new structure for representing the key parameters.

    * Removed most public key knowledge into the cipher library.

    * Support for dynamic loading of new algorithms.

    * Moved tiger to an extension module.


Noteworthy changes in version 0.2.19
------------------------------------

    * Replaced /dev/urandom in checks with new tool mk-tdata.

    * Some assembler file cleanups; some more functions for the Alpha.

    * Tiger has now the OpenPGP assigned number 6.  Because the OID has
      changed, old signatures using this algorithm can't be verified.

    * gnupg now encrypts the compressed packed and not any longer in the
      reverse order; anyway it can decrypt both versions. Thanks to Tom
      for telling me this (not security related) bug.

    * --add-key works and you are now able to generate subkeys.

    * It is now possible to generate ElGamal keys in v4 packets to create
      valid OpenPGP keys.

    * Some new features for better integration into MUAs.


Noteworthy changes in version 0.2.18
------------------------------------

    * Splitted cipher/random.c, add new option "--disable-dev-random"
      to configure to support the development of a random source for
      other systems. Prepared sourcefiles rand-unix.c, rand-w32.c
      and rand-dummy.c (which is used to allow compilation on systems
      without a random source).

    * Fixed a small bug in the key generation (it was possible that 48 bits
      of a key were not taken from the random pool)

    * Add key generation for DSA and v4 signatures.

    * Add a function trap_unaligned(), so that a SIGBUS is issued on
      Alphas and not the slow emulation code is used. And success: rmd160
      raised a SIGBUS.

    * Enhanced the formatting facility of argparse and changed the use of
      \r,\v to @ because gettext does not like it.

    * New option "--compress-algo 1" to allow the creation of compressed
      messages which are readable by PGP and "--print-md" (gpgm) to make
      speed measurement easier.


Noteworthy changes in version 0.2.17
------------------------------------

    * Comment packets are now of private type 61.

    * Passphrase code still used a 160 bit blowfish key, added a
      silly workaround. Please change your passphrase again - sorry.

    * Conventional encryption now uses a type 3 packet to describe the
      used algorithms.

    * The new algorithm number for Blowfish is 20, 16 is still used for
      encryption only; for signing it is only used when it is in a v3 packet,
      so that GNUPG keys are still valid.


Noteworthy changes in version 0.2.16
------------------------------------

    * Add experimental support for the TIGER/192 message digest algorithm.
      (But there is only a dummy ASN OID).

    * Standard cipher is now Blowfish with 128 bit key in OpenPGP's CFB
      mode. I renamed the old cipher to Blowfish160. Because the OpenPGP
      group refused to assign me a number for Blowfish160, I have to
      drop support for this in the future. You should use
      "--change-passphrase" to recode your current passphrase with 128
      bit Blowfish.


Noteworthy changes in version 0.2.15
------------------------------------

    * Fixed a bug with the old checksum calculation for secret keys.
      If you run the program without --batch, a warning does inform
      you if your secret key needs to be converted; simply use
      --change-passphrase to recalculate the checksum. Please do this
      soon, as the compatible mode will be removed sometime in the future.

    * CAST5 works (using the PGP's special CFB mode).

    * Again somewhat more PGP 5 compatible.

    * Some new test cases

Noteworthy changes in version 0.2.14
------------------------------------

    * Changed the internal handling of keyrings.

    * Add support to list PGP 5 keyrings with subkeys

    * Timestamps of signatures are now verified.

    * A expiration time can now be specified during key generation.

    * Some speedups for Blowfish and SHA-1, rewrote SHA-1 transform.
      Reduced the amount of random bytes needed for key generation in
      some cases.


Noteworthy changes in version 0.2.13
------------------------------------

    * Verify of DSA signatures works.

    * Re-implemented the slower random number generator.


Noteworthy changes in version 0.2.12
------------------------------------

    * --delete-key checks that there is no secret key. The new
      option --delete-secret-key maybe used to delete a secret key.

    * "-kv" now works as expected. Options "--list-{keys,sigs]"
      and "--check-sigs" are now working.

    * New options "--verify" and "--decrypt" to better support integration
      into MUAs (partly done for Mutt).

    * New option "--with-colons" to make parsing of key lists easier.

Noteworthy changes in version 0.2.11
------------------------------------

    * GPG now asks for a recipient's name if option "-r" is not used.

    * If there is no good trust path, the program asks whether to use
      the public keys anyway.

    * "--delete-key" works for public keys. What semantics shall I use
      when there is a secret key too? Delete the secret key or leave him
      and auto-regenerate the public key, next time the secret key is used?

Noteworthy changes in version 0.2.10
------------------------------------

    * Code for the alpha is much faster (about 20 times); the data
      was misaligned and the kernel traps this, so nearly all time
      was used by system to trap the misalignments and to write
      syslog messages. Shame on me and thanks to Ralph for
      pointing me at this while drinking some beer yesterday.

    * Changed some configure options and add an option
      --disable-m-guard to remove the memory checking code
      and to compile everything with optimization on.

    * New environment variable GNUPGHOME, which can be used to set
      another homedir than ~/.gnupg.  Changed default homedir for
      Windoze version to c:/gnupg.

    * Fixed detached signatures; detached PGP signatures caused a SEGV.

    * The Windoze version works (as usual w/o a strong RNG).


Noteworthy changes in version 0.2.9
-----------------------------------

    * Fixed FreeBSD bug.

    * Added a simple man page.

    * Switched to automake1.2f and a newer gettext.

Noteworthy changes in version 0.2.8
-----------------------------------

    * Changed the name to GNUPG, the binaries are called gpg and gpgm.
      You must rename rename the directory "~/.g10" to ~/.gnupg/, rename
      {pub,sec}ring.g10 to {pub,sec}ring.gpg, trustdb.g10 to trustdb.gpg
      and g10.sig to gnupg.sig.

    * New or changed passphrases are now salted.


Noteworthy changes in version 0.2.7
-----------------------------------

    * New command "gen-revoke" to create a key revocation certificate.

    * New option "homedir" to set the homedir (which defaults to "~/.g10").
      This directory is created if it does not exists (only the last
      part of the name and not the complete hierarchy)

    * Command "import" works. (Try: "finger gcrypt@ftp.guug.de|g10 --import")

    * New commands "dearmor/enarmor" for g10maint.  These are mainly
      used for internal test purposes.

    * Option --version now conforming to the GNU standards and lists
      the available ciphers, message digests and public key algorithms.

    * Assembler code for m68k (not tested).

    * "make check" works.

Noteworthy changes in version 0.2.6
-----------------------------------

    * Option "--export" works.


Noteworthy changes in version 0.2.5
-----------------------------------

    * Added zlib for systems which don't have it.
      Use "./configure --with-zlib" to link with the static version.

    * Generalized some more functions and rewrote the encoding of
      message digests into MPIs.

    * Enhanced the checkit script


Noteworthy changes in version 0.2.4
-----------------------------------

    * nearly doubled the speed of the ElGamal signature verification.

    * backup copies of keyrings are created.

    * assembler stuff for Pentium; gives about 15% better performance.

    * fixed a lot of bugs.


Noteworthy changes in version 0.2.3
-----------------------------------

    * Found a bug in the calculation of ELG fingerprints. This is now
      fixed, but all existing fingerprints and keyids for ELG keys
      are not any more valid.

    * armor should now work; including clear signed text.

    * moved some options to the new program g10maint

    * It's now 64 bit clean and runs fine on an alpha--linux.

    * Key generation is much faster now.  I fixed this by using not
      so strong random number for the primes (this was a bug because the
      ElGamal primes are public parameters and it does not make sense
      to generate them from strong random).  The real secret is the x value
      which is still generated from strong (okay: /dev/random) random bits.

    * added option "--status-fd": see g10/OPTIONS

    * We have secure memory on systems which support mlock().
      It is not complete yet, because we do not have signal handler
      which does a cleanup in very case.
      We should also check the ulimit for the user in the case
      that the admin does not have set a limit on locked pages.

    * started with internationalization support.

    * The logic to handle the web of trust is now implemented. It is
      has some bugs; but I'm going to change the algorithm anyway.
      It works by calculating the trustlevel on the fly.  It may ask
      you to provide trust parameters if the calculated trust probability
      is too low.  I will write a paper which discusses this new approach.

    * a couple of changes to the configure script.

    * New option "--quick-random" which uses a much quicker random
      number generator.  Keys generated while this option is in effect
      are flags with "INSECURE!" in the user-id.  This is a development
      only option.

    * Read support for new version packets (OpenPGP).

    * Comment packets are now of correct OpenPGP type 16. Old comment
      packets written by G10 are detected because they always start with
      a hash which is an invalid version byte.

    * The string "(INSECURE!)" is appended to a new user-id if this
      is generated on a system without a good random number generator.
