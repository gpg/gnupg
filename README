* INTRODUCTION

  GnuPG is a complete and free implementation of the OpenPGP standard
  as defined by RFC4880 (also known as PGP).  GnuPG enables encryption
  and signing of data and communication, and features a versatile key
  management system as well as access modules for public key
  directories.

  GnuPG, also known as GPG, is a command line tool with features for
  easy integration with other applications.  A wealth of frontend
  applications and libraries are available that make use of GnuPG.
  Starting with version 2 GnuPG provides support for S/MIME and Secure
  Shell in addition to OpenPGP.

  GnuPG is Free Software (meaning that it respects your freedom). It
  can be freely used, modified and distributed under the terms of the
  GNU General Public License.

  Note that the 2.0 series of GnuPG reached end-of-life on 2017-12-31.
  It is not possible to install a 2.2.x version along with any 2.0.x
  version.

* BUILD INSTRUCTIONS

  GnuPG 2.2 depends on the following GnuPG related packages:

    npth         (https://gnupg.org/ftp/gcrypt/npth/)
    libgpg-error (https://gnupg.org/ftp/gcrypt/libgpg-error/)
    libgcrypt    (https://gnupg.org/ftp/gcrypt/libgcrypt/)
    libksba      (https://gnupg.org/ftp/gcrypt/libksba/)
    libassuan    (https://gnupg.org/ftp/gcrypt/libassuan/)

  You should get the latest versions of course, the GnuPG configure
  script complains if a version is not sufficient.

  For some advanced features several other libraries are required.
  The configure script prints diagnostic messages if one of these
  libraries is not available and a feature will not be available..

  You also need the Pinentry package for most functions of GnuPG;
  however it is not a build requirement.  Pinentry is available at
  https://gnupg.org/ftp/gcrypt/pinentry/ .

  After building and installing the above packages in the order as
  given above, you may continue with GnuPG installation (you may also
  just try to build GnuPG to see whether your already installed
  versions are sufficient).

  As with all packages, you just have to do

    ./configure
    make
    make check
    make install

  The "make check" is optional but highly recommended.  To run even
  more tests you may add "--enable-all-tests" to the configure run.
  Before running the "make install" you might need to become root.

  If everything succeeds, you have a working GnuPG with support for
  OpenPGP, S/MIME, ssh-agent, and smartcards.  Note that there is no
  binary gpg but a gpg2 so that this package won't conflict with a
  GnuPG 1.4 installation.  gpg2 behaves just like gpg.

  In case of problem please ask on the gnupg-users@gnupg.org mailing
  list for advise.

  Instruction on how to build for Windows can be found in the file
  doc/HACKING in the section "How to build an installer for Windows".
  This requires some experience as developer.

  Note that the PKITS tests are always skipped unless you copy the
  PKITS test data file into the tests/pkits directory.  There is no
  need to run these test and some of them may even fail because the
  test scripts are not yet complete.

  You may run

    gpgconf --list-dirs

  to view the default directories used by GnuPG.

  To quickly build all required software without installing it, the
  Speedo method may be used:

    make -f build-aux/speedo.mk  native

  This method downloads all required libraries and does a native build
  of GnuPG to PLAY/inst/.  GNU make is required and you need to set
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH to $(pwd)/PLAY/inst/lib to test the binaries.

** Specific build problems on some machines:

*** Apple OSX 10.x using XCode

  On some versions the correct location of a header file can't be
  detected by configure.  To fix that you should run configure like
  this

    ./configure  gl_cv_absolute_stdint_h=/usr/include/stdint.h

  Add other options as needed.


*** Systems without a full C99 compiler

  If you run into problems with your compiler complaining about dns.c
  you may use

    ./configure --disable-libdns

  Add other options as needed.

* MIGRATION from 1.4 or 2.0 to 2.2

  The major change in 2.2 is gpg-agent taking care of the OpenPGP
  secret keys (those managed by GPG).  The former file "secring.gpg"
  will not be used anymore.  Newly generated keys are stored in the
  agent's key store directory "~/.gnupg/private-keys-v1.d/".  The
  first time gpg needs a secret key it checks whether a "secring.gpg"
  exists and copies them to the new store.  The old secring.gpg is
  kept for use by older versions of gpg.

  Note that gpg-agent now uses a fixed socket.  All tools will start
  the gpg-agent as needed.  The formerly used environment variable
  GPG_AGENT_INFO is ignored by 2.2.  The SSH_AUTH_SOCK environment
  variable should be set to a fixed value.

  The Dirmngr is now part of GnuPG proper and also used to access
  OpenPGP keyservers.  The directory layout of Dirmngr changed to make
  use of the GnuPG directories.  Dirmngr is started by gpg or gpgsm as
  needed. There is no more need to install a separate Dirmngr package.

  All changes introduced with GnuPG 2.2 have been developed in the 2.1
  series of releases.  See the respective entries in the file NEWS.

* RECOMMENDATIONS

** Socket directory

  GnuPG uses Unix domain sockets to connect its components (on Windows
  an emulation of these sockets is used).  Depending on the type of
  the file system, it is sometimes not possible to use the GnuPG home
  directory (i.e. ~/.gnupg) as the location for the sockets.  To solve
  this problem GnuPG prefers the use of a per-user directory below the
  the /run (or /var/run) hierarchy for the the sockets.  It is thus
  suggested to create per-user directories on system or session
  startup.  For example the following snippet can be used in
  /etc/rc.local to create these directories:

      [ ! -d /run/user ] && mkdir /run/user
      awk -F: </etc/passwd '$3 >= 1000 && $3 < 65000 {print $3}' \
        | ( while read uid rest; do
              if [ ! -d "/run/user/$uid" ]; then
                mkdir /run/user/$uid
                chown $uid /run/user/$uid
                chmod 700 /run/user/$uid
              fi
            done )

* DOCUMENTATION

  The complete documentation is in the texinfo manual named
  `gnupg.info'.  Run "info gnupg" to read it.  If you want a a
  printable copy of the manual, change to the "doc" directory and
  enter "make pdf" For a HTML version enter "make html" and point your
  browser to gnupg.html/index.html.  Standard man pages for all
  components are provided as well.  An online version of the manual is
  available at [[https://gnupg.org/documentation/manuals/gnupg/]] .  A
  version of the manual pertaining to the current development snapshot
  is at [[https://gnupg.org/documentation/manuals/gnupg-devel/]] .

* Installing GnuPG 2.2. and GnuPG 1.4

  GnuPG 2.2 is a current version of GnuPG with state of the art
  security design and many more features.  To install both versions
  alongside, it is suggested to rename the 1.4 version of "gpg" to
  "gpg1" as well as the corresponding man page.  Newer releases of the
  1.4 branch will likely do this by default.  In case this is not
  possible, the 2.2 version can be installed under the name "gpg2"
  using the configure option --enable-gpg-is-gpg2.

  authors and we try to answer questions when time allows us.

  Commercial grade support for GnuPG is available; for a listing of
  offers see https://gnupg.org/service.html.  Maintaining and
  improving GnuPG requires a lot of time.  Since 2001 g10 Code GmbH, a
  German company owned and headed by GnuPG's principal author Werner
  Koch and Gpg4win maintainer Andre Heinecke, is bearing the majority
  of these costs.  Under the brand https://gnupg.com g10 Code GmbH
  does now provide commercial offers.  Donations are also appreciated;
