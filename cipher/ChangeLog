	(generate): Ditto.
	(rsa_verify): Ditto.

	* blowfish.c, md5.c, rmd160.c, sha1.c, sha256.c, sha512.c: Use
	'#if' rather than '#ifdef' BIG_ENDIAN_HOST.  Harmless as we
	explicitly define BIG_ENDIAN_HOST to 1 when we need it, but needed

	Edit all preprocessor instructions to remove whitespace before the
	'#'.  This is not required by C89, but there are some compilers
	out there that don't like it.

2003-05-15  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* cipher.c (setup_cipher_table): #ifdef IDEA.

	* random.c (fast_random_poll): Only use times() if we HAVE_TIMES.

	* sha512.c, tiger.c: Use the U64_C() macro to specify 64-bit

	file is unloadable for some reason (unreadable, bad permissions,
	etc.)

	* md.c (string_to_digest_algo): Give a warning about TIGER192 not
	being part of OpenPGP.

2003-04-15  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

	* md.c (md_start_debug): Need to open the file in binary mode.

2003-02-21  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* cipher.c (setup_cipher_table): #ifdef all optional ciphers.

	* md.c (load_digest_module): #ifdef all optional digests.

2003-02-11  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* Makefile.am, md.c (load_digest_module): Only build in SHA384/512
	and TIGER if specifically enabled by the 64-bit type check in
	configure.

2003-02-04  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* sha256.c, sha512.c: New.

	* Makefile.am, algorithms.h, md.c (load_digest_module,
	string_to_digest_algo): Add read-only support for the new SHAs.

2002-11-06  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

 	* rndw32.c [__CYGWIN32__]: Don't include winioctl.h - it is not
	required anymore. (From Werner)

	* random.c (read_seed_file,update_random_seed_file): Use binary
	mode for __CYGWIN__. (From Werner)

	* blowfish.c (burn_stack), cast5.c (burn_stack), des.c
        (burn_stack), md5.c (burn_stack), random.c (burn_stack, read_pool,
	fast_random_poll), rijndael.c (burn_stack), rmd160.c (burn_stack),

2002-10-12  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

	* rndunix.c (my_popen): Make sure that stdin and stderr are
	connected to a file.  This is to avoid NetBSD to complain about
	set{u,g}id programs invoked with fd 0, 2 closed.  Reported by
	Cristian Biere.
	(start_gatherer): Likewise. Reordered code.

2002-10-02  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	compile time.

2002-09-27  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* Makefile.am, md.c (load_digest_module): TIGER is now always
	enabled.

2002-09-26  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

	* tiger.c (tiger_get_info): Use a regular OID.  Note that this
	breaks all TIGER generated signatures; if we want to do something
	about it we have to do it in ../g10/sig-check.c .

2002-09-17  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

	* rndw32.c (SIZEOF_DISK_PERFORMANCE_STRUCT): Increased to 256.

2002-09-12  Stefan Bellon  <sbellon@sbellon.de>

2002-08-20  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

	Bug reported by Bob Mathews.

	* random.c: "warning" -> "WARNING"

2002-07-02  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

	* rndw32.c (slow_gatherer_windowsNT): Use a simple array for the
	disk performance structure and increase it to the size required by
	W2000.

2002-06-29  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

	* rndlinux.c: Removed HAVE_LINUX_RANDOM_H conditional because it
	was never used and the configure test did set the wrong macro
	anyway.

2002-05-07  Stefan Bellon  <sbellon@sbellon.de>

	* md.c (md_start_debug): Use EXTSEP_S instead of ".".

2002-04-24  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

	* tiger.c (tiger_final): Removed superfluous token pasting operators.

2002-04-18  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

	* rndlinux.c, rndegd.c, rndunix.c (func_table): Made func a
	function pointer.  Note that we still need to change the module
	interface to cope with data vs function pointer problems.  Hmmm,
	even dlsym has a problem with this.

2002-04-10  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* cipher.c (setup_cipher_table, cipher_open, cipher_encrypt,
	cipher_decrypt, dummy_setkey, dummy_encrypt_block,
	dummy_decrypt_block): the dummy cipher should only be built on
	development versions.

2002-04-06  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

	* rijndael.c (rijndael_get_info): We do only support a 128 bit
	blocksize so it makes sense to change the algorithm strings to
	AES.
	* cipher.c (string_to_cipher_algo): Map "RIJNDAEL" to "AES".

2002-02-14  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

	* random.c (mix_pool): Removed the failsafe stuff again.  It makes
	the code more complicate and may give the path to more bugs.

2002-02-10  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

	* random.c (mix_pool): Carry an extra failsafe_digest buffer
	around to make the function more robust.

2002-02-08  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

	* random.c (add_randomness): Xor new data into the pool and not
	just copy it.  This avoids any choosen input attacks which are not
	serious in our setting because an outsider won't be able to mix
	data in and even then we keep going with a PRNG.  Thanks to Stefan
	Keller for pointing this out.

2002-01-02  Stefan Bellon  <sbellon@sbellon.de>

	* rndriscos.c [__riscos__]: Updated include file name.

2001-12-21  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

	* primegen.c (gen_prime): Set 2 high order bits for secret primes.
	* rsa.c (generate): Loop until we find the exact modulus size.
	Changed the exponent to 41.

2001-10-22  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

	* Makefile.am: Need to use $(EXEEXT) where approriate.

2001-09-09  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

	* rsa.c (rsa_get_info): s/usage/r_usage/ to avoid shadow warnings.

2001-08-24  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

	* md.c (md_write): Made buf arg const.

2001-08-22  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

	* random.c (fast_random_poll): Don't use gethrtime if it is broken.

2001-08-20  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

	Applied patches from Stefan Bellon <sbellon@sbellon.de> to support
	RISC OS.  Nearly all of these patches are identified by the
	__riscos__ macro.
	* blowfish.c, twofish.c: Added pragmas for use with a Norcraft
	compiler. 
	* dynload.c, md5.c, rmd160.c, sha1.c: Minor patches for RISC OS.
	* rndriscos.c: New.
	* rnd-internal.h: Added prototype.
	* random.c (fast_random_poll): Use '#if defined' instead of just
	'defined'; needed for RISC OS.
	* primegen.c (gen_prime): count? are now ints for consistence
	with is_prime().

2001-08-08  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

	* rndw32.c (gather_random): Use toolhelp in addition to the NT
	gatherer for Windows2000.  Suggested by Sami Tolvanen.

	* random.c (read_pool): Fixed length check, this used to be one
	byte to strict.  Made an assert out of it because the caller has
	already made sure that only poolsize bytes are requested.
	Reported by Marcus Brinkmann.

2001-07-18  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

	* rndlinux.c (gather_random): casted a size_t arg to int so that
	the format string is correct.  Casting is okay here and avoids
	translation changes.

2001-04-06  Werner Koch  <wk@gnupg.org>

	* rijndael.c, des.c, blowfish.c, twofish.c, cast5.c (burn_stack):
	New.  Add wrappers for most functions to be able to call
	burn_stack after the function invocation. This methods seems to be
	the most portable way to zeroise the stack used. It does only work
	on stack frame based machines but it is highly portable and has no
	side effects.  Just setting the automatic variables at the end of
	a function to zero does not work well because the compiler will
	optimize them away - marking them as volatile would be bad for
	performance.
	* md5.c, sha1.c, rmd160.c, tiger.c (burn_stack): Likewise.
	* random.c (burn_stack): New.
	(mix_pool): Use it here to burn the stack of the mixblock function.

Wed Oct  4 15:50:18 CEST 2000  Werner Koch  <wk@openit.de>

        * sha1.c (transform): Use rol() macro.  Actually this is not needed
