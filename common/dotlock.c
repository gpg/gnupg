   Overview:
   =========

   This module implements advisory file locking in a portable way.
   Due to the problems with POSIX fcntl locking a separate lock file
   is used.  It would be possible to use fcntl locking on this lock
   file and thus avoid the weird auto unlock bug of POSIX while still
   having an unproved better performance of fcntl locking.  However
   there are still problems left, thus we resort to use a hardlink
   which has the well defined property that a link call will fail if
   the target file already exists.

   Given that hardlinks are also available on NTFS file systems since
   Windows XP; it will be possible to enhance this module to use
   hardlinks even on Windows and thus allow Windows and Posix clients
   to use locking on the same directory.  This is not yet implemented;
   instead we use a lockfile on Windows along with W32 style file
   locking.

   On FAT file systems hardlinks are not supported.  Thus this method
   does not work.  Our solution is to use a O_EXCL locking instead.
   Querying the type of the file system is not easy to do in a
   portable way (e.g. Linux has a statfs, BSDs have a the same call
   but using different structures and constants).  What we do instead
   is to check at runtime whether link(2) works for a specific lock
   file.


   How to use:
   ===========

   At program initialization time, the module should be explicitly
   initialized:

      dotlock_create (NULL, 0);

   This installs an atexit handler and may also initialize mutex etc.
   It is optional for non-threaded applications.  Only the first call
   has an effect.  This needs to be done before any extra threads are
   started.

   To create a lock file (which  prepares it but does not take the
   lock) you do:

     dotlock_t h

     h = dotlock_create (fname, 0);
     if (!h)
       error ("error creating lock file: %s\n", strerror (errno));

   It is important to handle the error.  For example on a read-only
   file system a lock can't be created (but is usually not needed).
   FNAME is the file you want to lock; the actual lockfile is that
   name with the suffix ".lock" appended.  On success a handle to be
   used with the other functions is returned or NULL on error.  Note
   that the handle shall only be used by one thread at a time.  This
   function creates a unique file temporary file (".#lk*") in the same
   directory as FNAME and returns a handle for further operations.
   The module keeps track of theses unique files so that they will be
   unlinked using the atexit handler.  If you don't need the lock file
   anymore, you may also explicitly remove it with a call to:

     dotlock_destroy (h);

   To actually lock the file, you use:

     if (dotlock_take (h, -1))
       error ("error taking lock: %s\n", strerror (errno));

   This function will wait until the lock is acquired.  If an
   unexpected error occurs if will return non-zero and set ERRNO.  If
   you pass (0) instead of (-1) the function does not wait in case the
   file is already locked but returns -1 and sets ERRNO to EACCES.
   Any other positive value for the second parameter is considered a
   timeout value in milliseconds.

   To release the lock you call:

     if (dotlock_release (h))
       error ("error releasing lock: %s\n", strerror (errno));

   or, if the lock file is not anymore needed, you may just call
   dotlock_destroy.  However dotlock_release does some extra checks
   before releasing the lock and prints diagnostics to help detecting
   bugs.

   If you want to explicitly destroy all lock files you may call

     dotlock_remove_lockfiles ();

   which is the core of the installed atexit handler.  In case your
   application wants to disable locking completely it may call

     disable_locking ()

   before any locks are created.

   There are two convenience functions to store an integer (e.g. a
   file descriptor) value with the handle:

     void dotlock_set_fd (dotlock_t h, int fd);
     int  dotlock_get_fd (dotlock_t h);

   If nothing has been stored dotlock_get_fd returns -1.



   How to build:
   =============

   This module was originally developed for GnuPG but later changed to
   allow its use without any GnuPG dependency.  If you want to use it
   with you application you may simply use it and it should figure out
   most things automagically.

   You may use the common config.h file to pass macros, but take care
   to pass -DHAVE_CONFIG_H to the compiler.  Macros used by this
   module are:

     DOTLOCK_USE_PTHREAD  - Define if POSIX threads are in use.

     DOTLOCK_GLIB_LOGGING - Define this to use Glib logging functions.

     DOTLOCK_EXT_SYM_PREFIX - Prefix all external symbols with the
                              string to which this macro evaluates.

     GNUPG_MAJOR_VERSION - Defined when used by GnuPG.

     HAVE_DOSISH_SYSTEM  - Defined for Windows etc.  Will be
                           automatically defined if a the target is
                           Windows.

     HAVE_POSIX_SYSTEM   - Internally defined to !HAVE_DOSISH_SYSTEM.

     HAVE_SIGNAL_H       - Should be defined on Posix systems.  If config.h
                           is not used defaults to defined.

     DIRSEP_C            - Separation character for file name parts.
                           Usually not redefined.

     EXTSEP_S            - Separation string for file name suffixes.
                           Usually not redefined.

     HAVE_W32CE_SYSTEM   - Currently only used by GnuPG.

   Note that there is a test program t-dotlock which has compile
   instructions at its end.  At least for SMBFS and CIFS it is
   important that 64 bit versions of stat are used; most programming
   environments do this these days, just in case you want to compile
   it on the command line, remember to pass -D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64


   Bugs:
   =====

   On Windows this module is not yet thread-safe.


   Miscellaneous notes:
   ====================

   On hardlinks:
   - Hardlinks are supported under Windows with NTFS since XP/Server2003.
   - In Linux 2.6.33 both SMBFS and CIFS seem to support hardlinks.
   - NFS supports hard links.  But there are solvable problems.
   - FAT does not support links

   On the file locking API:
   - CIFS on Linux 2.6.33 supports several locking methods.
     SMBFS seems not to support locking.  No closer checks done.
   - NFS supports Posix locks.  flock is emulated in the server.
     However there are a couple of problems; see below.
   - FAT does not support locks.
   - An advantage of fcntl locking is that R/W locks can be
     implemented which is not easy with a straight lock file.

   On O_EXCL:
   - Does not work reliable on NFS
   - Should work on CIFS and SMBFS but how can we delete lockfiles?

   On NFS problems:
   - Locks vanish if the server crashes and reboots.
   - Client crashes keep the lock in the server until the client
     re-connects.
   - Communication problems may return unreliable error codes.  The
     MUA Postfix's workaround is to compare the link count after
     seeing an error for link.  However that gives a race.  If using a
     unique file to link to a lockfile and using stat to check the
     link count instead of looking at the error return of link(2) is
     the best solution.
   - O_EXCL seems to have a race and may re-create a file anyway.
