This is Debian GNU's prepackaged version of GnuPG, a free PGP
replacement.

This package was put together by me, James Troup <james@nocrew.org>,
from the sources, which I obtained from
ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/pub/gcrypt/gnupg/gnupg-1.0.5.tar.gz.  The changes
were minimal, namely:

- adding support for the Debian package maintenance scheme, by adding
  various debian/* files.
