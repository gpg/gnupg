Due to a bug in the way secret keys were encrypted in versions prior
to 0.3.3, this version of gnupg is not backwards compatible with $2
which you have (had) installed on your system.  

There is an upgrade strategy (see /usr/doc/gnupg/NEWS.gz after this
version is installed), but it requires an old copy of the gpg and gpgm

If at any stage you need a pre-0.3.3 gnupg, you can find source and
binaries for i386, m68k, alpha, powerpc and hurd-i386 at
