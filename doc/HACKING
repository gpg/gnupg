* No more ChangeLog files

Do not modify any of the ChangeLog files in GnuPG.  Starting on
December 1st, 2011 we put change information only in the GIT commit
log, and generate a top-level ChangeLog file from logs at "make dist"
time.  As such, there are strict requirements on the form of the
commit log messages.  The old ChangeLog files have all be renamed to
ChangeLog-2011


* Commit log requirements

Your commit log should always start with a one-line summary, the second
line should be blank, and the remaining lines are usually ChangeLog-style
entries for all affected files.  However, it's fine -- even recommended --
to write a few lines of prose describing the change, when the summary
and ChangeLog entries don't give enough of the big picture.  Omit the
leading TABs that you're used to seeing in a "real" ChangeLog file, but
keep the maximum line length at 72 or smaller, so that the generated
ChangeLog lines, each with its leading TAB, will not exceed 80 columns.

Memory allocation
-----------------
Use only the functions:

    xmalloc
    xmalloc_secure
    xtrymalloc
    xtrymalloc_secure
    xcalloc
    xcalloc_secure
    xtrycalloc
    xtrycalloc_secure
    xrealloc
    xtryrealloc
    xstrdup
    xtrystrdup
    xfree


The *secure versions allocated memory in the secure memory. That is,
swapping out of this memory is avoided and is gets overwritten on
free.  Use this for passphrases, session keys and other sensitive
material.  This memory set aside for secure memory is linited to a few
k.  In general the function don't print a memeory message and
terminate the process if there is not enough memory available.  The
"try" versions of the functions return NULL instead.


Logging

Option parsing
---------------
GNUPG does not use getopt or GNU getopt but functions of it's own.  See
util/argparse.c for details.  The advantage of these functions is that
it is more easy to display and maintain the help texts for the options.
The same option table is also used to parse resource files.



What is an IOBUF
----------------
This is the data structure used for most I/O of gnupg.	It is similar
to System V Streams but much simpler.  Because OpenPGP messages are nested
in different ways; the use of such a system has big advantages.  Here is
an example, how it works:  If the parser sees a packet header with a partial
length, it pushes the block_filter onto the IOBUF to handle these partial
length packets: from now on you don't have to worry about this.  When it sees
a compressed packet it pushes the uncompress filter and the next read byte
is one which has already been uncompressed by this filter. Same goes for
enciphered packet, plaintext packets and so on.  The file g10/encode.c
might be a good staring point to see how it is used  - actually this is
the other way: constructing messages using pushed filters but it may be
easier to understand.
