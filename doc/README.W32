This is a binary version of GnuPG for MS-Windows 95, 98, WNT and W2000.


PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH CAREFULLY:

If you have a bug report, please post it to the mailing list
<gnupg-devel@gnupg.org>.  Please don't send me private mail
regarding this version of GnuPG; I am already spending too much
time on answering the same and same questions over and over.
I can improve GnuPG much faster if I don't have to answer
questions in private mail.  You can post to the mailing list
without prior subscribing (but please request to CC you if you want
to get an answer).



Installation instructions:
--------------------------
 1. Unpack the ZIP archive (alright, you already did this).
 2. Copy "gpg.exe" to some place where you usually store your
    binaries.
 3. Create a directory "c:\gnupg" (or any other as you like)
 4. If you did not use the default directory "c:\gnupg", you
    should enter a string with the directory into the Registry
    under the key:
	 \\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\GNU\GnuPG\HomeDir
    Please use forward slashes and not the backslashes when
    setting filenames for GnuPG into the Registry.
 5. Enter "gpg" and see what happens
 6. Read the file README and the online HOWTOs


Internationalization support:
-----------------------------
  1. Decide where to store the translation files for your language.
     Here we assume the directory "c:/gnu/locale/fr"
  2. Set the directory with the translations into the Registry under the key:
	\\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Mingw32\NLS\MODir
     (Example entry: "c:/gnu/locale/fr")
  3. Select which language to use and copy the currect translation file
     under the name "gnupg.mo" into the directory set in step 2
     (Example:	"copy fr.mo c:\gnu\locale\fr\gnupg.mo")
  4. Done.

Currently we only support the Codepages 437, 850 und Latin1.  If you have
problems, either delete the gnupg.mo file or don't set the environment
variable



How to build it from the source:
--------------------------------
This version has been build with the Mingw32/CPD kit using the latest
stable version of GnuPG.

First get the source:  It is available at

  ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/gnupg/gnupg-1.0.n.tar.gz

or for snapshots (with a letter appended to the version number)

  ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/devel/gnupg-1.0.nx.tar.gz

this is the same source as for the Unix version.  If your binary
version of GnuPG is called something like gnupg-w32-1.0.4-1.zip, you
should find a patch file named gnupg-w32-1.0.4-1.0.4-1.diff.gz at the
same location, which has to ne applied to the stock gpg source file.
Instructions are at the top of this file.

To build it, you need the MingW32/CPD kit, which is available at

  ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/people/werner/cpd/mingw32-cpd-0.3.0.tar.gz
  ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/people/werner/cpd/gcc-core-2.95.2.tar.gz
  ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/people/werner/cpd/binutils-2.9.1.tar.gz

gcc and binutils are stock GNU source which are available
at every GNU mirror. 

After you have installed this environment you should be able to do this:

 $ scripts/autogen.sh --build-w32
 $ make
 $ mingw32 strip g10/gpg
 $ cp g10/gpg  /some_windows_drive/gpg.exe

And everything hopefully works.


Don't forget that MS-Windows ist just a temporary workaround until
you can switch to a GNU system ;-)

Be the source always with you.
