Daily use of &Gnupg;
</title>

<para>
&Gnupg; is a complex tool with technical, social, and legal issues
surrounding it.
Technically, it has been designed to be used in situations having
drastically different security needs.
This complicates key management.
Socially, using &gnupg; is not strictly a personal decision.
To use &gnupg effectively both parties communicating must use it.
Finally, as of 1999, laws regarding digital encryption, and in particular
whether or not using &gnupg; is legal, vary from country to country and 
is currently being debated by many national governments.
</para>

<para>
This chapter addresses these issues.
It gives practical advice on how to use &gnupg; to meet your security needs.
It also suggests ways to promote the use of &gnupg; for secure
communication between yourself and your colleagues when your colleagues
are not currently using &gnupg;.
Finally, the legal status of &gnupg; is outlined given the current status
of encryption laws in the world.
</para>

<sect1>
<title>
Defining your security needs
</title>

<para>
&Gnupg; is a tool you use to protect your privacy.
Your privacy is protected if you can correspond with others without
eavesdroppers reading those messages.
</para>

<para>
How you should use &gnupg; depends on the determination and resourcefulness
of those who might want to read your encrypted messages.
An eavesdropper may be an unscrupulous system administrator casually
scanning your mail, it might be an industrial spy trying to collect
your company's secrets, or it might be a law enforcement agency trying
to prosecute you.
Using &gnupg; to protect against casual eavesdropping is going to be
different than using &gnupg; to protect against a determined adversary.
Your goal, ultimately, is to make it more expensive to recover the
unencrypted data than that data is worth.
</para>

<para>
Customizing your use of &gnupg; revolves around three issues:
<itemizedlist spacing="compact">

<listitem>

</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

A well-chosen key size protects you against brute-force attacks on
encrypted messages.
Protecting your private key prevents an attacker from simply using your
private key to decrypt encrypted messages and sign messages in your name.
Correctly managing your web of trust prevents attackers from masquarading
as people with whom you communicate.
Ultimately, addressing these issues with respect to your own security
needs is how you balance the extra work required to use &gnupg; with
the privacy it gives you.
</para>

<sect2>
<title>
Choosing a key size
</title>

<para>
Selecting a key size depends on the key.
In OpenPGP, a public/private keypair usually has multiple keys.
At the least it has a master signing key, and it probably has one or
more additional subkeys for encryption.
Using default key generation parameters with &gnupg;, the master
key will be a DSA key, and the subkeys will be ElGamal keys.
</para>

<para>
DSA allows a key size up to 1024 bits.
This is not especially good given today's factoring technology, but
that is what the standard specifies.
Without question, you should use 1024 bit DSA keys.
</para>

<para>
ElGamal keys, on the other hand, may be of any size.
Since &gnupg; is a hybrid public-key system, the public key is used
to encrypt a 128-bit session key, and the private key is used to
decrypt it.
Key size nevertheless affects encryption and decryption speed
since the cost of these algorithms is exponential in the size of
the key.
Larger keys also take more time to generate and take more space
to store.
Ultimately, there are diminishing returns on the extra security
a large key provides you.
After all, if the key is large enough to resist a brute-force
attack, an eavesdropper will merely switch to some other method for
obtaining your plaintext data.
Examples of other methods include robbing your home or office
and mugging you.
1024 bits is thus the recommended key size.
If you genuinely need a larger key size then you probably already
know this and should be consulting an expert in data security.
</para>
</sect2>

<title>
Protecting your private key
</title>

<para>
Protecting your private key is the most important job you have to
use &gnupg; correctly.
If someone obtains your private key, then all data encrypted to
the private key can be decrypted and signatures can be made in your name.
If you lose your private key, then you will no longer be able to 
decrypt documents encrypted to you in the future or in the past,
and you will not be able to make signatures.
Losing sole possession of your private key is catastrophic.
</para>

<para>
Regardless of how you use &gnupg; you should store the public
key's <link linkend="revocation">revocation certificate</link> 
and a backup of your private key on write-protected media in a safe place.
For example, you could burn them on a CD-ROM and store them in your
safe deposit box at the bank in a sealed envelope.
Alternatively, you could store them on a floppy and hide it in your
house.
Whatever you do, they should be put on media that is safe to store
for as long as you expect to keep the key, and you should store
them more carefully than the copy of your private key you use daily.
</para>

<para>
To help safeguard your key, &Gnupg; does not store your raw
private key on disk.
Instead it encrypts it using a symmetric encryption algorithm.
That is why you need a passphrase to access the key.
Thus there are two barriers an attacker must cross to access your private
key: (1) he must actually acquire the key, and (2) he must get past
the encryption.
</para>

<para>
Safely storing your private key is important, but there is a cost.
Ideally, you would keep the private key on a removable, write-protected disk
such as a floppy disk, and you would use it on a single-user machine 
not connected to a network.
This may be inconvenient or impossible for you to do.
For example, you may not own your own machine and must use a computer 
at work or school, or it may mean you have to physically disconnect
your computer from your cable modem every time you want to use &gnupg;
</para>

<para>
This does not mean you cannot or should not use &gnupg;.
It means only that you have decided that the data you are protecting is
important enough to encrypt but not so important as to take extra
steps to make the first barrier stronger.
It is your choice.
</para>

<para>
A good passphrase is absolutely critical when using &gnupg;.
Any attacker who gains access to your private key must bypass the 
encryption on the private key.
Instead of brute-force guessing the key, an attacker will almost
certainly instead try to guess the passphrase.
</para>

<para>
The motivation for trying passphrases is that most people choose
a passphrase that is easier to guess than a random 128-bit key.
If the passphrase is a word, it is much cheaper to try all the
words in the dictionaries of the world's languages.
Even if the word is permuted, &eg, k3wldood, it is still easier
to try dictionary words with a catalog of permutations.
The same problem applies to quotations.
In general, passphrases based on natural-language utterances
are poor passphrases since there is little randomness and lots
of redundancy in natural language.
You should avoid natural language passphrases if you can.
</para>

<para>
A good passphrase is one that you can remember but is hard for
someone to guess.
It should include characters from the whole range of printable characters
on your keyboard.
This includes uppercase alphabetics characters, numbers, and special
characters such as <literal>}</literal> and <literal>|</literal>.
Be creative and spend a little time considering your passphrase; a
good choice is important to ensure your privacy.
</para>

Reacting to a compromised private key
</title>

<para>
Despite your precautions you may lose sole access to your private key.
For example, you may forget the passphrase, or someone who you think 
can bypass the encryption gets access to it.
In that case then you need to spread the word that your key is no 
longer valid.
To do that you use the key revocation certificate you should have generated
when you created the key.
Importing it onto your public keyring will revoke the public key
of the keypair you no longer wish to use.
It is then up to you to distribute the revoked public key to all 
those who may encrypt documents to you.
</para>

<para>
A revoked public key only prevents future use of the private key.
Others will neither be able to encrypt documents to the key nor will
they be able to check signatures made with the private key.
Documents signed in the past can still be checked, however, and
documents encrypted in the past can still be decrypted.
</para>

<para>
It is important that you protect the revocation certificate carefully.
Anybody can add the certificate to your public key and distribute it,
and there is no way to revoke a revocation certificate.
Therefore, you should store the revocation certificate in a safe
place such as with the backup of your private key.
</para>

Managing your web of trust
</title>

<para>
As with protecting your private key, managing your web of trust is
another aspect of using &gnupg; that requires balancing security against
ease of use.
If you are using &gnupg; to protect against casual eavesdropping and
forgeries then you can afford to be relatively trusting of other
people's signatures.
On the other hand, if you are concerned that there may be a determined
attacker interested in invading your privacy, then
you should be much less trusting of other signatures and spend more time 
personally verifying signatures.
</para>

<para>
Regardless of your own security needs, through, you should 
<emphasis>always be careful</emphasis> when signing other keys.
It is selfish to sign a key with just enough confidence in the key's
validity to satisfy your own security needs.
Others, with more stringent security needs, may want to depend on 
your signature.
If they cannot depend on you then that weakens the web of trust
and makes it more difficult for all &gnupg; users to communicate.
Use the same care in signing keys that you would like others to use when
you depend on their signatures.
</para>

<para>
In practice, managing your web of trust reduces to assigning trust to 
others and tuning the options 
<link linkend="marginals-needed"><option>--marginals-needed</option></link>
and 
<link linkend="completes-needed"><option>--completes-needed</option></link>.
Any key you personally sign will be considered valid, but except for small
groups, it will not be practical to personally sign the key of every person
with whom you communicate.
You will therefore have to assign trust to others.
</para>

<para>
It is probably wise to be accurate when assigning trust and then
use the options to tune how careful &gnupg; is with key validation.
As a concrete example, you may fully trust a few close friends that
you know are careful with key signing and then marginally
trust all others on your keyring.
From there, you may set <option>--completes-needed</option> to
<literal>1</literal> and <option>--marginals-needed</option> to
<literal>2</literal>.
If you are more concerned with security you might choose values of
<literal>1</literal> and <literal>3</literal> or <literal>2</literal>
and <literal>3</literal> respectively.
If you are less concerned with privacy attacks and just want some
reasonable confidence about validity, set the values to <literal>1</literal>
and <literal>1</literal>.
In general, higher numbers for these options imply that more people
would be needed to conspire against you in order to have a key validated
that does not actually belong to the person whom you think it does.

Building your web of trust
</title>

<para>
Wanting to use &gnupg; yourself is not enough.
In order to use to communicate securely with others you must have
a web of trust.
At first glance, however, building a web of trust is a daunting task.
The people with whom you communicate need to use 
&gnupg;<footnote><para>In this section, &gnupg; refers to the 
&gnupg; implementation of OpenPGP as well as other implementations 
such as NAI's PGP product.</para></footnote>, and there needs to be enough 
key signing so that keys can be considered valid.
These are not technical problems; they are social problems.
Nevertheless, you must overcome these problems if you want to 
use &gnupg;.
</para>

<para>
When getting started using &gnupg; it is important to realize that you
need not securely communicate with every one of your correspondents.
Start with a small circle of people, perhaps just yourself and
one or two others who also want to exercise their right
to privacy.
Generate your keys and sign each other's public keys.
This is your initial web of trust.
By doing this you will appreciate the value of a small, robust
web of trust and will be more cautious as you grow your web
in the future.
</para>

<para>
In addition to those in your initial web of trust, you may want to
communicate securely with others who are also using &gnupg;.
Doing so, however, can be awkward for two reasons:
(1) you do not always know when someone uses or is willing to use
&gnupg;, and (2) if you do know of someone who uses it, you may still have
trouble validating their key.
The first reason occurs because people do not always advertise that
they use &gnupg;.
The way to change this behavior is to set the example and advertise 
that you use &gnupg;.
There are at least three ways to do this: you can sign messages you mail
to others or post to message boards, you can put your public key on your
web page, or, if you put your key on a keyserver, you can put your key
ID in your email signature.
If you advertise your key then you make it that much more acceptable
for others to advertise their keys.
Furthermore, you make it easier for others to start communicating
with you securely since you have taken the initiative and made it clear
that you use &gnupg;.
</para>

<para>
Key validation is more difficult.
If you do not personally know the person whose key you want to sign,
then it is not possible to sign the key yourself.
You must rely on the signatures of others and hope to find a chain
of signatures leading from the key in question back to your own.
To have any chance of finding a chain, you must take the intitive
and get your key signed by others outside of your intitial web of trust.
An effective way to accomplish this is to participate in key
signing parties.
If you are going to a conference look ahead of time for a key
signing party, and if you do not see one being held, offer to 
<ulink url="http://www.herrons.com/kb2nsx/keysign.html">hold one</ulink>.
You can also be more passive and carry your fingerprint with you
for impromptu key exchanges.
In such a situation the person to whom you gave the fingerprint
would verify it and sign your public key once he returned home.
</para>

<para>
Keep in mind, though, that this is optional.
You have no obligation to either publically advertise your key or
sign other people's keys.
The power of &gnupg; is that it is flexible enough to adapt to your
security needs whatever they may be.
The social reality, however, is that you will need to take the initiative
if you want to grow your web of trust and use &gnupg; for as much of 
your communication as possible.
