2007-08-02  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* ldap.m4: Revert the mozldap change: mozldap has some significant
	differences around TLS compared to OpenLDAP, and will segfault (!)
	if the NSS library is not initialized first.  Nothing impossible
	to do, but I think I'll wait until someone actually asks us for
	mozldap support.

2007-07-27  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* ldap.m4: If we don't find ldap or winldap, try for mozldap.

2007-01-16  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* libcurl.m4: Check for curl_easy_escape() and
	curl_easy_unescape().  Replace with curl_escape() and
	curl_unescape() if libcurl doesn't have it.

2006-10-02  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

	* autobuild.m4: New.

2006-07-12  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* tar-ustar.m4: Use dd instead of strings as it's more likely to
	be around.  Suggested by Nelson H. F. Beebe.

2006-07-11  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* tar-ustar.m4: Not all greps know the -q (quiet) flag, so
	redirect to /dev/null instead.

	* tar-ustar.m4: Pass tar data through strings so that greps that
	don't grep in binary files (Solaris) can detect the string.  Noted
	by Mark Davies.

2006-06-25  Werner Koch  <wk@g10code.com>

	* Makefile.am: Added noexecstack.m4 and ldap.m4

2006-05-22  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@g10code.de>

	* noexecstack.m4: New file.

2006-05-09  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* libcurl.m4: Fix mistaken AC_SUBST when curl is not found.

2006-01-17  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* libcurl.m4: Add IDN, SSPI, NTLM, and TFTP defines.

2006-01-16  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* libcurl.m4: Remove GOPHER, as that is not supported in libcurl
	any longer.

2005-11-05  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* libusb.m4: Check for libusb-config and if we find it, use --libs
	and --cflags.  This is needed for OS X since libusb brings in
	dependencies to various Apple libraries.

2005-10-21  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* readline.m4: Check for rl_completion_func_t and
	rl_completion_matches.

2005-08-05  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* ldap.m4: If a PATH is given to --with-ldap, bias directory
	search towards the given path for includes and libraries.  Noted
	by Jason Harris.

	* Makefile.am: Distribute tar-ustar.m4.

	* libcurl.m4: If a PATH is given to --with-libcurl, look for
	curl-config in that path.  Bias directory search towards the given
	path for includes and libraries.

2005-08-04  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* tar-ustar.m4: New.  Check for a tar that creates USTAR format
	tar files.

2005-07-20  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* libcurl.m4: Check that our libcurl has
	curl_version_info(CURLINFO_NOW).

2005-06-22  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* libcurl.m4: Only do the OS X linker fix on Panther.  Tiger has a
	clean curl-config.

2005-04-24  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* libcurl.m4: Add a check for curl_free() since older versions of
	libcurl don't have it.  Substitute free() as an alternative.

2005-03-21  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* readline.m4: Check for completion functionality.

	* ldap.m4: Comments.

2005-03-16  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* ldap.m4: New.  Moved from configure.ac.

2005-02-28  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* libcurl.m4: Use $LIBS instead of $LDFLAGS.  This should help
	build problems on Mingw32.

2005-02-03  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* libcurl.m4: More comments.

2005-01-24  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* libcurl.m4: All versions of curl-config support --feature.

2005-01-22  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* libcurl.m4: Note that FTPS existed, but wasn't fully
	standards-compliant until version 7.11.0.

2005-01-17  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* libcurl.m4: Use LIBCURL_CPPFLAGS and not LIBCURL_INCLUDES to
	match automake syntax.

2005-01-03  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* Makefile.am, libusb.m4: New libusb check macro.

2004-12-24  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* libcurl.m4: Rewrite this to use the new --protocols flag I gave
	to the libcurl people.

	* Makefile.am: Add readline.m4 and libcurl.m4.

2004-12-23  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* libcurl.m4: OSX has a problem with their curl-config script.

	* readline.m4: Make sure that readline is modern enough to
	understand rl_catch_signals.

	* libcurl.m4: Don't require curl-config to be present since it
	seems some binary packages don't include it.  Allow users to
	specify LIBCURL and LIBCURL_INCLUDES for us.

2004-12-22  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* libcurl.m4: Be much more strict with libcurl by trying to
	compile and link a test program that uses the features that we
	need.

2004-12-21  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* libcurl.m4: New.

2004-12-18  David Shaw  <dshaw@jabberwocky.com>

	* readline.m4: New.
