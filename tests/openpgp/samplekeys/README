Notes:

- pgp-desktop-skr.asc is a secret keyblock without the uid and subkey
  binding signatures.  When exporting a secret key from PGP desktop
  such a file is created which is then directly followed by a separate
  armored public key block.  To create such a sample concatenate
  pgp-desktop-skr.asc and E657FB607BB4F21C90BB6651BC067AF28BC90111.asc
- ecc-sample-2-sec.asc and ecc-sample-3-sec.asc do not have and
  binding signatures either.  ecc-sample-1-sec.asc has them, though.
